      "abstract": "Scaling laws for autoregressive generative recommenders reveal potential for larger, more versatile systems but mean greater latency and training costs. To accelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative recommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$α$, identifying two efficiency bottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and the computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that relative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as attention maps. Previous works like Synthesizer have shown that alternative forms of attention maps can achieve similar performance, naturally raising the question of whether some attention maps are redundant. Through empirical experiments, we discovered that using the query-key attention map might degrade the model's performance in recommendation tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose a new framework applicable to Transformer-like recommendation models. On one hand, we introduce Functional Relative Attention Bias, which avoids the time-consuming operations of the original relative attention bias, thereby accelerating the process. On the other hand, we remove the query-key attention map from the original self-attention layer and design a new Attention-Free Token Mixer module. Furthermore, by applying this framework to FuXi-$α$, we introduce a new model, FuXi-$β$. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FuXi-$β$ outperforms previous state-of-the-art models and achieves significant acceleration compared to FuXi-$α$, while also adhering to the scaling law. Notably, FuXi-$β$ shows an improvement of 27% to 47% in the NDCG@10 metric on large-scale industrial datasets compared to FuXi-$α$.

          "original": "Recent advancements [1, 3, 14, 24] in scaling laws have revealed that\nthe performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) systematically\nimproves predictably as the number of model parameters, the vol-\nume of training data, and computational resources increase. These\nfindings are crucial as they provide researchers and practitioners\nwith a framework for efficiently allocating limited computational\nresources to optimize model performance. Building on this founda-\ntion, we propose to investigate whether recommendation models\nalso conform to scaling laws. By identifying such models, scaling\nlaws can be utilized to guide the training of larger models, thus\nenhancing their performance.\nBesides the scaling laws found in LLMs such as GPTs [1, 3], LLa-\nMAs [10, 53], autoregressive sequential models have been shown to\nadhere to scaling laws across various domains, including generative\nimage modeling, video modeling, etc [19]. The expansion of Vision\nTransformers (ViT) has also achieved significant success in the field\nof computer vision [9, 73]. This revolutionary innovation has also\nbeen extended to recommendation models. Recent studies [47, 76]\ndemonstrate that autoregressive sequence recommendation models\nalso follow these scaling laws. The success of projects like HSTU\n[4, 60, 71] indicates that scaling up sequential recommendation\nmodels in accordance with these laws is an effective strategy for\ndeveloping large-scale recommendation systems.\nSequential recommendation models have been a focal point of\nresearch in the field of recommender systems, characterized by a\nwide array of architectural innovations [36, 48, 55, 57, 62, 63, 68].\n1\narXiv:2502.03036v1  [cs.IR]  5 Feb 2025\n\nWWW ’25, 28 April - 2 May, 2025, Sydney, Australia Ye and Guo, et al.\nInitially, pooling operations were employed to manage interaction\nsequences [8]. With the development of deep learning, more sophis-\nticated models emerged, including CNN-based architectures such\nas Caser [52], GNN-based models like SR-GNN [ 61], RNN-based\nframeworks like GRU4Rec [ 20]. Inspired by the huge success of\nTransformers in NLP, models based on self-attention mechanisms\nwere proposed, leading to notable architectures such as SASRec\n[23] and Bert4Rec [51].\nBesides sequential recommendation models, traditional Deep\nLearning Recommendation Models (DLRMs), such as DCN [ 58]\nand xDeepFM [33], also play a crucial role in recommender sys-\ntems. A fundamental concept in these DLRMs is feature interaction,\nwhich is pivotal for enhancing model performance. Feature interac-\ntions are categorized into two types: explicit and implicit. Explicit\ninteractions model feature relationships directly through various\noperators, such as the dot product [43, 58], bilinear functions [33],\nand attention mechanisms [50]. Conversely, implicit interactions\nare facilitated by applying deep neural networks (DNNs). Although\nsuch an approach lacks interpretability, it is extensively used in\nstate-of-the-art DLRMs such as DCN [58], DCNv2 [59], DeepFM\n[13], and PNN [40]. In fact, the integrated DNNs in such models\nare a key driver of their superior performance. However, previous\nstudies [2, 15] have indicated that DLRMs do not necessarily exhibit\nsignificant performance improvements with increased model size.\nNonetheless, the concept of feature interaction can still guide us in\ndesigning models.\nFrom the perspective of feature interaction, sequential recom-\nmendation models can be conceptualized as exploring the interplay\nbetween various features over time. Pooling methods [8] have lim-\nited expressive capabilities because they overlook the semantic\nrichness of interaction sequences. CNN-based methods [ 52] are\nconstrained by a fixed window size, limiting their ability to capture\nlong-range dependencies. RNN-based models [20] interact directly\nwith the previous timestep’s hidden state, which can restrict their\ncapacity to model complex interactions. GNN-based approaches\n[61] limit feature interactions to directly connected items, thereby\nnarrowing their scope. In contrast, attention-based models, includ-\ning SASRec [23], BERT4Rec [51], TiSASRec [29], and HSTU [72],\nenable comprehensive item interactions. Consequently, these mod-\nels are more effective at capturing dynamic user interests through\ninteraction sequences. TiSASRec [29] further improves on SASRec\nby incorporating time intervals and relative position information,\nenhancing its performance. HSTU [72] advances this by utilizing\npositional and temporal information alongside element-wise mul-\ntiplication to model explicit interactions between items, thereby\ndemonstrating superiority over its predecessors.\nDespite the significant advancements made in the aforemen-\ntioned work, there remain several shortcomings that need to be\naddressed. Firstly, previous studies fail to fully leverage temporal\nand positional information in explicit interactions. They integrate\nthis information by simply adding embeddings to input sequences\n[23], incorporating them into the query and key matrices used in\nself-attention layers [29], or adjusting attention weights [72]. Com-\npared to various methods that facilitate feature interactions, this\nsimple addition lacks expressive capacity. Understanding positional\nand temporal information is crucial for sequential recommendation\nbecause different cues can lead to varying results, as illustrated\nItem sequence 2\nItem sequence 3\ntime\nItem sequence 1\ntime\nFigure 1: Different temporal intervals or orders between ob-\njects may lead to varying subsequent interacted items.\nin Figure 1. However, existing models have limited feature inter-\naction with temporal and positional information, hence severely\nrestricting their ability to effectively convey the corresponding\ntemporal and positional cues. Secondly, while HSTU emphasizes\nexplicit interactions, it underemphasizes implicit feature interac-\ntions, potentially leading to a loss of nuanced learning processes\npost-interaction and thus constraining the model’s expressiveness.\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel\nattention-based model named FuXi-𝛼. Our approach introduces\nan Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention (AMS) layer, which re-\nsolves the issue of insufficient feature interactions by modeling the\ntemporal and positional information separately. Furthermore, we\nintegrate a multi-stage feedforward neural network (MFFN) layer to\nfacilitate implicit feature interactions, thereby boosting the model’s\nexpressiveness. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art\nsequential recommendation techniques across several benchmark\ndatasets. We also evaluate the model’s adherence to scaling laws\nusing a large-scale industrial dataset. The results indicate that per-\nformance consistently improves with increased model complexity,\nhighlighting its potential for large-scale recommendation systems.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n• We propose a novel model, FuXi-𝛼, which adheres to the scaling\nlaw by leveraging the perspective of feature interactions.\n• We design an Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention (AMS) layer\nthat disentangles the modeling of temporal, positional, and se-\nmantic information. We demonstrate that it permits a more ex-\npressive representation of temporal and positional information.\nAdditionally, we introduce a Multi-stage Feedforward Network\n(MFFN) to enhance implicit feature interactions.\n• We conducted extensive experiments on multiple real-world\ndatasets and online A/B tests on Huawei Music, demonstrating\nour model’s strong performance. Specifically, the online deploy-\nment led to an increase of 4.76% in the average number of song\nplays per user and a 5.10% enhancement in the average duration\nof song playback per user.",

HSTU [4, 60, 71]와 같은 프로젝트의 성공은 이러한 법칙에 따라 시퀀스 추천 모델을 확장하는 것이 대규모 추천 시스템 개발을 위한 효과적인 전략임을 시사한다.\n\n추천 시스템 분야에서 시퀀스 추천 모델은 광범위한 아키텍처 혁신 [36, 48, 55, 57, 62, 63, 68]로 특징지어지는 핵심 연구 분야이다.\n\n초기에는 상호 작용 시퀀스를 관리하기 위해 풀링 연산이 사용되었다 [8]. 딥러닝의 발전과 함께 CNN 기반 아키텍처(예: Caser [52], GNN 기반 모델인 SR-GNN [61], RNN 기반 프레임워크인 GRU4Rec [20])를 포함한 더욱 정교한 모델이 등장했다. 트랜스포머의 엄청난 성공에 영감을 받아, 자기-주의 메커니즘을 기반으로 하는 모델이 제안되었으며, SASRec [23] 및 BERT4Rec [51]와 같은 주목할 만한 아키텍처를 이끌었다.\n\n시퀀스 추천 모델 외에도, DCN [58] 및 xDeepFM [33]와 같은 딥러닝 추천 모델(DLRM) 또한 추천 시스템에서 중요한 역할을 한다. 이러한 DLRM의 핵심 개념은 특징 간 상호 작용이며, 모델 성능 향상에 매우 중요하다. 특징 간 상호 작용은 두 가지 유형으로 분류할 수 있다: 명시적 및 암시적. 명시적 상호 작용은 다양한 연산자(예: 내적 [43, 58], 이진 함수 [33], 주의 메커니즘 [50])를 통해 특징 간 관계를 직접 모델링한다. 반대로, 암시적 상호 작용은 딥 뉴럴 네트워크(DNN)를 적용하여 촉진된다. 이러한 접근 방식은 해석 가능성이 부족하지만, DCN [58], DCNv2 [59], DeepFM [13], PNN [40]와 같은 최첨단 DLRM에서 널리 사용된다. 실제로 이러한 모델에서 통합된 DNN은 그 우수한 성능의 핵심 동인이다. 그러나 이전 연구 [2, 15]는 DLRM이 모델 크기가 증가함에 따라 반드시 상당한 성능 개선을 보이지 않는다는 것을 시사한다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 특징 간 상호 작용의 개념은 여전히 모델 설계를 안내하는 데 도움이 될 수 있다.\n\n특징 간 상호 작용 관점에서 볼 때, 시퀀스 추천 모델은 시간에 따른 다양한 특징 간의 상호 작용을 탐색하는 것으로 개념화할 수 있다. 풀링 방법 [8]은 상호 작용 시퀀스의 의미적 풍부함을 간과하기 때문에 표현 능력이 제한된다. CNN 기반 방법 [52]는 고정된 윈도우 크기로 인해 장거리 의존성을 캡처하는 능력을 제한한다. RNN 기반 모델 [20]은 이전 타임스텝의 숨겨진 상태와 직접 상호 작용할 수 있어 복잡한 상호 작용을 모델링하는 능력을 제한할 수 있다. GNN 기반 접근 방식 [61]은 직접 연결된 항목 간의 특징 간 상호 작용을 제한하여 범위를 좁힌다. 반대로, 주의 기반 모델(예: SASRec [23], BERT4Rec [51], TiSASRec [29], HSTU [72])는 포괄적인 항목 간 상호 작용을 가능하게 한다. 결과적으로 이러한 모델은 상호 작용 시퀀스를 통해 사용자 관심의 동적을 더 효과적으로 캡처할 수 있다. TiSASRec [29]는 SASRec을 개선하여 시간 간격 및 상대적 위치 정보를 통합함으로써 성능을 향상시킨다. HSTU [72]는 위치 및 시간 정보를 요소별 곱셈과 함께 사용하여 항목 간 명시적 상호 작용을 모델링함으로써 전임자보다 우수한 성능을 보여줌으로써 이를 발전시켰다.\n\n앞서 언급한 작업의 상당한 진전을 고려할 때, 여전히 해결해야 할 몇 가지 문제점이 존재한다. 첫째, 이전 연구는 명시적 상호 작용에서 시간 및 위치 정보를 완전히 활용하지 못했다. 이 정보를 단순히 입력 시퀀스에 임베딩을 추가하거나 통합함으로써 통합했으며...\n\n[... 길이 제한으로 생략 ...]"

          "translated": "2.1 Scaling Law\nScaling laws, prevalent in Natural Language Processing (NLP) [1, 3, 24, 70], describe the relationship between a model’s performance and its size, training data, and computational resources. These laws extend beyond NLP to domains like autoregressive generative models [19] and visual processing [30, 39, 65, 66, 74]. In the recommendation domain, applying scaling laws is challenging. Studies show that scaling benefits do not always apply to recommendation models [2, 15]. Issues such as embedding collapse have been reported [15], and increasing non-embedding parameters in Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) offers minimal gains [2].\n\nDespite these challenges, research into scaling laws for recommendation models persists. Studies have explored scaling in user ad activity sequences with generative models [7] and efforts to scale user representation models [ 49]. A sequential recommendation model with 0.8 billion parameters has been developed, highlighting scaling laws in this domain [ 76]. Additionally, it was found that increasing computational resources benefits DLRM less than Generative Recommendations (GR) [72]. This led to the development of HSTU, enhancing the GR paradigm in feature processing, model architecture, and efficiency [72].\n\nOur study proposes a model designed to adhere to scaling laws, facilitating its expansion into a large-scale recommendation model for improved performance.\n\n2.2 Sequential Recommendation\nSequential recommendation focuses on predicting users’ future interests based on past interactions [16, 17, 67, 69]. Early approaches used Markov Chain models [45]. With advancements in neural networks, various architectures have enhanced sequential modeling. GRU4Rec [20] uses Gated Recurrent Units to capture sequential data, while Caser [ 52] employs CNNs for short-term preference patterns.

Sequences shorter than 𝑛 are padded with a spe-\ncial \"padding item\". In the embedding layer, each item 𝑖 ∈ I is\nmapped to a 𝑑-dimensional vector using a learnable embedding\nmatrix E ∈ R| I | ×𝑑 where 𝑑 is the latent vector dimensionality.\nWe also employ learnable positional encodings [12], where 𝒑𝑖 de-\nnotes the positional embedding of the 𝑖-th position in the sequence.\nFor a user 𝑢 with a sequence S𝑢 = [𝑖 (𝑢 )\n1 , . . . , 𝑖(𝑢 )\n𝑛𝑢 ], the output is\nx0 = [e(𝑢 )\n1 + 𝒑1, . . . , e(𝑢 )\n𝑛𝑢 + 𝒑𝑛𝑢 , 0, · · ·, 0], where the zero vectors\ndenote the padding items for positions beyond 𝑛𝑢 up to 𝑛.\n3\n\nWWW ’25, 28 April - 2 May, 2025, Sydney, Australia Ye and Guo, et al.\nAdaptive Multi-channel Self-attention\nMulti-stage FFN\nInteraction sequence\nFuxi BlockFuxi Block\nFuxi BlockMLPOutput Predictions\nEmbedding Layer\nFigure 2: The overall architecture of the proposed FuXi-𝛼.\n4.2 FuXi Block\nThe core component of our model is composed of𝑏 stacked layers of\nFuXi block which are similar to the transformer decoder [54]. Each\nFuXi block consists of an Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention\n(AMS) layer and a Multi-stage Feed-Forward Network (MFFN). The\nadaptive multi-channel self-attention is a variant of the multi-head\nself-attention [54], while the multi-stage FFN first combines the\nmulti-channel outputs of the AMS layer and then performs implicit\nfeature interactions. In this architecture, let x𝑙 −1 ∈ R𝑛×𝑑 denote\nthe input to the 𝑙-th layer, and x𝑙 ∈ R𝑛×𝑑 denote the output of the\n𝑙-th layer. The initial input for the first layer is given by x0.\n4.2.1 Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention The AMS layer is de-\nsigned to effectively capture and utilize the user interest patterns\ninherent in sequential data. Unlike conventional multi-head self-\nattention mechanisms, which typically integrate positional encod-\nings directly into the input embeddings, our FuXi self-attention\nseparates the processing of hidden states, positional information,\nand temporal signals into distinct attention heads. This separation\nallows each head to specialize in capturing different aspects of the\nsequence data, thereby enhancing the model’s capacity to learn\ncomplex interest patterns.\nAs depicted in Figure 3, we define three types of channels: se-\nmantic, temporal, and positional channels. The attention weights\nin the temporal and positional channels depend only on the dif-\nference in relative timestamps and relative positions. Additionally,\nthere is no further need to calculate the query and key matrices\nin these two channels. To circumvent the intricacy of the model,\nwe opt not to employ extra value matrices for the temporal and\npositional heads. Instead, they will share the value matrices with\nthe semantics channel. The following approach is used to compute\nthese matrices which is similar to multi-head self-attention:\n˜x𝑙 = RMSN(x𝑙 −1) (1)\nq𝑙 = 𝜙 ( ˜x𝑙 W𝑙\n𝑞), k𝑙 = 𝜙 ( ˜x𝑙 W𝑙\n𝑘 ), v𝑙 = 𝜙 ( ˜x𝑙 W𝑙\nℎ) (2)\nwhere W𝑙𝑞 ∈ R𝑑 ×𝑑ℎ, W𝑙\n𝑘 ∈ R𝑑 ×𝑑ℎ, W𝑙𝑣 ∈ R𝑑 ×𝑑ℎ are the learn-\nable parameters. RMSN denotes the root mean square (RMS) layer\nnormalization operation [75]. 𝜙 provides nonlinearity which we\nemploy SiLU [11] here, and 𝑑ℎ represents the size of each head.\nRelativeEmbedding\nInput\n𝑉\nPositionTimestamp\n𝐴!𝐴\"\n𝑊# 𝑊$ 𝑊%\nOutput\n𝑊&\n×\n𝜙𝑄𝐾𝑉Semantic Channel𝐴𝑉PositionalChannel𝐴𝑉TemporalChannel\nLayer Normalization\nFigure 3: Illustration of Adaptive Multi-channel Self-\nattention (AMS). In contrast to the conventional multi-head\nself-attention, AMS decouples the modeling of temporal and\npositional information from semantics information.\nThe following describes the method for calculating the attention\nweights for semantic, temporal, and positional channels separately:\na𝑙\nℎ = 1\n𝑛 𝜙 (q𝑙 (k𝑙 )𝑇 ), (a𝑙\n𝑡 )𝑖,𝑗 = 𝛼 (𝑡 𝑗 − 𝑡𝑖 ), (a𝑙\n𝑝 )𝑖,𝑗 = 𝛽 𝑗 −𝑖 (3)\nwhere, 𝜙 supplies nonlinearity, and we leverage SiLU once again.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that the use of SiLU function\nin self-attention layers outperforms softmax in sequence recom-\nmendation tasks [72]. The term 𝛼 (𝑡 𝑗 − 𝑡𝑖 ) represents the mapping\nof the difference in timestamps into buckets, where each bucket\nis associated with a learnable parameter [42]. On the other hand,\n𝛽 ∈ R𝑛 denotes a vector of learnable parameters.\nSubsequent to the computation of outputs from the channels,\nthese outputs are concatenated and subjected to RMS layer nor-\nmalization. Following this, the normalized result is element-wise\nmultiplied with the matrix𝑈 , which is derived from ˜𝑥𝑙 . The process\nis encapsulated by the following formula:\nh𝑙 = RMSN(concat(a𝑙\nℎv𝑙\nℎ, a𝑙\n𝑝 v𝑙\n𝑝, a𝑙\n𝑡 v𝑙\n𝑡 )) ⊗ 𝜙 (x𝑙 W𝑙\n𝑢 ) (4)\nhere W𝑙𝑢 ∈ R𝑑 ×3𝑑ℎ denotes learnable parameters and 𝜙 denotes\nSiLU function. We adopted the design of the matrix 𝑈 in our ar-\nchitecture following HSTU [ 72] to introduce explicit 2-order in-\nteractions. For simplicity and clarity, we describe the case with a\nsingle head in each channel here. However, this approach can be\neasily extended to multiple heads within each channel, similar to\nthe multi-head self-attention [54].\n4.2.2 Multi-stage Feed-Forward Network The MFFN encompasses\ntwo distinct stages as depicted in Figure 4. In the first stage, the\noutputs from different channels are fused with the original input of\nthe current layer. Subsequently, in the second stage, implicit feature\ninteractions are conducted.·\nIn the first stage, MFFN receives the outputs across different\nchannels from the AMS layer and applies a projection transfor-\nmation characterized by learnable parameters 𝑊𝑜 ∈ R3𝑑ℎ ×𝑑. The\noutput of this stage is obtained by combining the projected output\n4\n\nFuXi-𝛼: Scaling Recommendation Model with Feature Interaction Enhanced Transformer WWW ’25, 28 April - 2 May, 2025, Sydney, Australia\nStage 1\nStage 2\nAMS outputinput𝑊!\n𝑊\"\n+\n𝑊#\n𝑊$\n×\n+\nLayer Normalization\nMFFN output\nFigure 4: Diagram of MFFN: Stage 1 fuses outputs from differ-\nent channels; Stage 2 facilitates implicit feature interactions.\nwith the input of current layer x𝑙 .\no𝑙 = h𝑙 W𝑙\n𝑜 + x𝑙 −1 (5)\nIn the second stage, the primary objective of MFFN is to conduct\nimplicit interactions. Following LLaMa [53], we apply RMS layer\nnormalization to the output of the previous stage and followed by\na SwiGLU activation [ 46] to enhance feature learning and then\nadding the residual connection:\nx𝑙 = FFN𝑙 (RMSN(o𝑙 )) + o𝑙 (6)\nFFN𝑙 (x) = SwiGLU(x)W𝑙\n3 = (𝜙 (xW𝑙\n1) ⊗ ( xW𝑙\n2))W𝑙\n3 (7)\nwhere 𝜙 represents SiLU, ⊗ denotes element-wise multiplication,\nand W𝑙\n1 ∈ R𝑑 ×𝑑𝐹 𝐹 𝑁 , W𝑙\n2 ∈ R𝑑 ×𝑑𝐹 𝐹 𝑁 , W𝑙\n3 ∈ R𝑑𝐹 𝐹 𝑁 ×𝑑 are learnable\nparameters. This configuration allows the network to effectively\ncapture complex interactions within the data while maintaining\nefficient gradient flow through the residual connections.\n4.3 Prediction Layer & Optimization objective\nAfter passing through 𝑏 layers of FuXi blocks, each position has\nobtained sufficient information about the previously interacted\nitems. We employ a multiplication with the transpose of the input\nembedding matrix, followed by a softmax function to obtain a\nprobability distribution over predicted items.

The AMS layer features four projection matrices totaling\n6𝑑 × 𝑑𝐻 parameters, alongside positional and temporal embeddings\nwith 𝑂 (𝑛 + 𝑛𝐵) parameters, where 𝑛𝐵 is the number of buckets.\nThe MFFN includes four projection matrices, amounting to 3𝑑ℎ ×\n𝑑 + 3𝑑𝐹 𝐹 𝑁 × 𝑑 parameters. The item embeddings have |I | × 𝑑\nparameters. Typically,𝑑ℎ and 𝑑𝐹 𝐹 𝑁 are proportional to 𝑑, and 𝑛 is\ncomparable to 𝑛𝐵. Therefore, we assume 𝑑ℎ = 𝑂 (𝑑), 𝑑𝐹 𝐹 𝑁 = 𝑂 (𝑑),\nand 𝑛𝐵 = 𝑂 (𝑛). FuXi-𝛼 is formed by stacking 𝑏 FuXi layers, leading\nto a total space complexity of 𝑂 (𝑏 (𝑑2 + 𝑛) + |I |𝑑).\nTime Complexity The time complexity for computing attention\nweights in the semantics channel is 𝑂 (𝑛2𝑑), compared to 𝑂 (𝑛2) in\nother channels. Calculating the QKV matrices and the MFFN both\nrequire 𝑂 (𝑛𝑑2). The cost for generating predictions is 𝑂 (𝑛|I |𝑑).\nThus, the overall time complexity is 𝑂 (𝑏𝑛2𝑑 + 𝑛(𝑏𝑑 2 + |I |𝑑)).\n5.2 Polynomial Approximation\nNext, we examine the properties of explicit inter-item interactions\nimplemented by FuXi-𝛼. To better analyze these interactions, we\nsimplify the 𝑙-th layer of the FuXi Block by treating attention\nweights as constants and omitting the second stage of the MFFN,\nactivation functions, and most projection transformations. This\nsimplification yields:\n𝑓 (𝑙 )\n𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘 (𝑥𝑖 ; 𝑥1, · · ·𝑥𝑛) = 𝑥𝑖 ◦ ©­\n«\n𝑛∑︁\n𝑗=1\n𝑎 (𝑙 )\n𝑖,𝑗 𝑥 𝑗\nª®\n¬\n+ 𝑥𝑖 (9)\nwhere the vectors 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛 are the latent representations input to\nthe 𝑙-th layer of the FuXi block; ◦ denotes the interaction operator,\nsuch as element-wise multiplication; and 𝑎 (𝑙 )\n𝑖,𝑗 are the attention\nweights in the 𝑙-th layer. In this section, let 𝑥𝑙,𝑖 denote the output\nlatent representation of the 𝑖-th item after the 𝑙-th layer. Let 𝐹𝑛\ndenote a polynomial of the form Í\n𝜶 𝑤 𝜶\nÎ\n𝑖 𝑥𝛼𝑖\n0,𝑖, where the sum\nincludes all terms satisfying Í 𝛼𝑖 ≤ 𝑛. We will use mathematical\ninduction to show that 𝑥𝑏,𝑖 = 𝑥𝑖,0𝐹2𝑏 −1.\n5.2.1 Base Case Consider 𝑏 = 0. Here, 𝑥0,𝑖 = 𝑥0,𝑖 · 1 = 𝑥0,𝑖 · 𝐹0,\nconfirming the equation holds.\n5.2.2 Inductive Step Assume the property holds for some integer\n𝑙 ≥ 0. Now consider 𝑏 = 𝑙 + 1:\n𝑥𝑙+1,𝑖 = 𝑥𝑙,𝑖 ◦\n𝑛∑︁\n𝑗=1\n𝑎 (𝑙+1)\n𝑖,𝑗 𝑥𝑙,𝑗 + 𝑥𝑙,𝑖 (10)\n= 𝑥0,𝑖𝐹2𝑙 −1 ◦ ©­\n«\n𝑛∑︁\n𝑗=1\n𝑎 (𝑙+1)\n𝑖,𝑗 𝑥0,𝑗 𝐹2𝑙 −1 + 1ª®\n¬\n(11)\nFor any term of the formÎ\n𝑗 𝑥𝛼𝑖\n0,𝑗 , where 1 ≤ Í 𝛼𝑖 ≤ 2𝑙+1, it appears\nin the expression Í𝑛\n𝑗=1 𝑎 (𝑙+1)\n𝑖,𝑗 𝑥0,𝑗 𝐹2𝑙 −1. Thus, we have\n𝑛∑︁\n𝑗=1\n𝑎 (𝑙+1)\n𝑖,𝑗 𝑥0,𝑗 𝐹2𝑙 −1 + 1 = 𝐹2𝑙 (12)\nTherefore, it follows that 𝑥𝑙+1,𝑖 = 𝑥0,𝑖𝐹2𝑙 +1 −1.\nConsequently, after progressing through 𝑏 layers of the FuXi\nblocks, 𝑥𝑏,𝑖 incorporates the outcome of feature interaction between\n𝑥0,𝑖 and the result of interactions among all the items being of any\ndegree up to 2𝑙 − 1.\n5.3 Analysis of AMS\nThe formulation of relative positional embeddings in the T5 ar-\nchitecture [ 42] is delineated as follows.

Here, we highlight the key\ndifferences between these models and our approach.\n5.4.1 SASRec and LLaMa Unlike SASRec and LLaMa, which em-\nploy standard NLP architectures for recommendation systems, our\nmodel introduces two major innovations. First, instead of the tra-\nditional multi-head self-attention layer, we use the AMS layer to\nindependently model temporal, positional, and semantic informa-\ntion, improving the model’s feature utilization. Second, our model\nincorporates the MFFN, diverging from the FFN used in SASRec\nand LLaMa, by processing multi-channel information from the\nself-attention layer and enabling implicit feature interaction.\n5.4.2 HSTU HSTU incorporates relative temporal and positional\ndata by adding these features directly to attention weights, which\ncan dilute their impact. Moreover, HSTU lacks an FFN layer, relying\nsolely on self-attention and explicit feature interactions, limiting its\nability to capture complex item relationships. Our model overcomes\nthese limitations by decoupling temporal, positional, and semantic\ninformation within the self-attention layer and leveraging the MFFN\nto facilitate implicit interactions.",

          "original": "6.1 Experiment Setup\n6.1.1 Datasets To evaluate the performance of the proposedFuXi-𝛼\narchitecture, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets, including three public datasets and one private large-scale\ndataset, which are described as follows:\n• MovieLens-1M and MovieLens-20M1. The MovieLens dataset\nis a widely used movie recommendation dataset, which con-\ntains users’ rating and tagging activities. It has multiple sub-\nsets of different sizes. We select two subsets, MovieLens-1M and\nMovieLens-20M for our experiments.\n• KuaiRand2. This dataset is collected with the user logs of a video-\nsharing app from kuaishou. Users in this platform are usualy very\nactive, with more than 200 interactions on average.\n• Industrial This dataset is constructed from user records of a\nmainstream music listening app, which has tens of millions active\nusers every month. We construct users’ behavior sequence with\nover a month of positive behaviors, including collect, like, play\nand so on.\nFor the first two datasets (MovieLens-1M and MovieLens-20M),\nwe use the pre-processed train/validation/test set 3 as in HSTU\n[72] from Meta exactly. For the latter two datasets (KuaiRand and\nIndustrial), we process them using a similar manner to HSTU [72]\nby ourself. The statistics are shown in Table 1.\n6.1.2 Compared Baseline For a comprehensive comparison, we\ncompare FuXi-𝛼 against two types of representative baselines: i)\nconventional models, including BPRMF [44], GRU4Rec [20], and\nNARM [28]; ii) autoregressive generative models, including SASRec\n[23], LLaMa [10], and HSTU [72].\n6.1.3 Evaluation Metrics We employ the widely used top-K Hit Ra-\ntio (HR@𝐾), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@𝐾)\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to evaluate the recall perfor-\nmances. For all metrics, higher value means better performance.\nWe rank the ground-truth item from full set of items and report the\nperformance of 𝐾 = 10, 50 by default.\n6.1.4 Parameter Settings We implement our proposed FuXi-𝛼 with\nPytorch [38]. To enable large-scale model training, we apply the\nmulti-machine and multi-card parallelism with the Accelerate li-\nbrary [26]. For a fair comparison, we maintain the same model\nparameters as HSTU [72] in the first two datasets, except for the\nnumber of layers. For the KuaiRand dataset, we set the hidden\ndimension as 50, and the number of negative samples as 128 by de-\nfault. All other parameters like optimizer, learning rate and weight\ndecay are consistent with HSTU [72]. For all the three datasets, the\nembedding dimensions and self-attention hidden vector dimensions\nare identical. For the basic modeling capacity comparison, we set\nthe number of layers as 2. We also extend these generative models\nto deeper layers by stacking 4x number of layers (8 layers) and\ndenoting it as \"XX-Large\" to analyze scaling effects.\n6.2 Performance Comparison (RQ1)\n6.2.1 Public Dataset Performance The overall performance com-\nparison of the proposed FuXi-𝛼 and baseline models are shown in\nTable 2. Based on the results, we have the following observations:\n• Firstly, the generative models (i.e., SASRec, LLaMa, HSTU, and\nFuXi-𝛼) outperform conventional models (i.e., BPRMF, GRU4Rec\nand NARM), even when equipped with just two layers of pa-\nrameters. This demonstrates the generative models’ superior\n1https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/\n2https://kuairand.com/\n3https://github.com/facebookresearch/generative-recommenders\n6\n\nFuXi-𝛼: Scaling Recommendation Model with Feature Interaction Enhanced Transformer WWW ’25, 28 April - 2 May, 2025, Sydney, Australia\nTable 2: The overall performance comparison.

In\ncontrast, the two recently proposed transformer-based architec-\ntures, LLaMa and HSTU, show substantial improvements in the\nfirst two datasets.\n• Finally, FuXi-𝛼 consistently obtains the best results on all three\ndatasets with all evaluation metrics, no matter it’s a shallow\nnetwork or a deep network. This demonstrates the outstand-\ning ability of our proposed FuXi-𝛼. Specifically, for shallow net-\nwork, it outperforms the strongest baseline HSTU by 13.24% in\nNDCG@10 (10.59% in NDCG@50, 10.81% in HR@10, 6.94% in\nHR@50, 13.72% in MRR) on average of the three datasets.

The current\nonline baseline in this scenario is a multi-channel recall system,\nwith SASRec as one of the channels that recalls items based on\nembedding similarity. The music recalled from multiple channels\nis mixed together and then passed through a cascaded pre-ranking\nand ranking process to obtain the final recommended music list.\nFrom Table 3, we have two key observations. Firstly, the newly\nproposed LLaMa and HSTU significantly outperform SASRec in\nthis music recommendation scenario, achieving gains of 64.82% and\n71.75% in NDCG@10, respectively. Secondly, our FuXi-𝛼 outper-\nforms both LLaMa and HSTU by 11.54% and 8.19%, respectively.\nThese substantial improvements highlight the potential of scaling\nlaws, and the superiority of our proposed FuXi-𝛼.\n6.2.3 Scaling of FuXi- 𝛼 on Industrial Dataset Figure 5 presents\nthe performance of our proposed FuXi-𝛼 on the industrial dataset\nwhen scaling up the number of layers while keeping all other hyper-\nparameters unchanged. Due to the memory limitation, we only scale\nup the layers to 32. We observe that FuXi-𝛼 adheres to the scaling\nlaw, as the results show a positive relationship between the model’s\nperformance and its size.

Ex-\nperiments were conducted on the KuaiRand dataset with sequence\nlengths ranging from 200 to 800. Each experiment involved three\ncomplete forward and backward propagations across the dataset,\ncalculating the average number of training samples processed per\nsecond. All hyperparameters, except sequence length, were consis-\ntent with previous experiments. Table 4 shows the TPS results. As\nsequence length increases, TPS for all models decreases. Notably,\nSASRec and LLaMa outperform HSTU andFuXi-𝛼 in TPS, likely due\nto their exclusion of temporal information encoding, which, while\nperformance-enhancing, is time-intensive. Consequently, FuXi-𝛼\nachieves similar TPS to HSTU but significantly better overall per-\nformance, as seen in Tables 2 and 3.\n6.4 Ablation Study (RQ3)\nTo assess the effectiveness of sub-modules in our FuXi-𝛼 architec-\nture, we analyze three model variants: (1) Base Model: Replaces\nthe AMS module with the vanilla self-attention layer from SASRec\nand substitutes the MFFN module with a single-stage MLP from\nHSTU. (2) w/o AMS : Replaces the AMS module with the vanilla\nself-attention layer. (3) w/o MFFN : Substitutes the MFFN module\nwith a single-stage MLP.\nTable 5 presents the ablation results, revealing the critical role\nof each component in model performance. Notably, removing the\nsecond stage of the MFFN results in a significant performance drop,\nemphasizing the importance of thorough implicit feature interac-\ntions. Despite this, the model still outperforms HSTU, demonstrat-\ning the effectiveness of our approach in capturing temporal and\npositional information. Additionally, replacing the AMS with the\nvanilla self-attention layer leads to a marked performance decline,\nhighlighting the necessity of explicit feature interactions and effec-\ntive use of temporal and positional data in recommendation tasks.\nThese results confirm the essential contributions of each module to\nthe model’s predictive capability.\n6.5 Hyperparameter Study (RQ4)\nWe examine the effects of various hyper-parameters on FuXi-𝛼,\nfocusing on (1) the number of layers, (2) the hidden dimension,\nand (3) the number of negative samples for training. Due to space\nconstraints, we present only NDCG@10 and HR@10 results for\nthe MovieLens-1M and KuaiRand datasets.

We alter one hyper-parameter at a time while\nkeeping others constant to ensure fair comparisons.\n6.5.1 The number of layers Increasing layers is a rapid method\nto scale model parameters and enhance FuXi-𝛼’s representational\ncapacity. We vary layers from 2 to 16, as shown in Figure 6. On\nMovieLens-1M, performance improves from 2 to 8 layers, but de-\nclines at 16 layers. Conversely, on KuaiRand, performance consis-\ntently increases from 2 to 16 layers. This may be due to MovieLens-\n1M’s smaller size limiting parameter scaling.\n6.5.2 The hidden dimension Uniform embedding and self-attention\nhidden dimensions are used across datasets. Increasing hidden di-\nmensions enhances item representation and self-attention similarity\naccuracy. Adjusting dimensions from 8 to 64, Figure 7 shows perfor-\nmance on MovieLens-1M saturates at 32 dimensions, with minimal\ngains beyond. In contrast, KuaiRand performance steadily improves\nacross all dimensions.\n6.5.3 Negative Samples The influence of negative sampling on large\nrecommendation models has been overlooked in studies on LLM\nscaling laws [21, 24]. We vary negative samples from 32 to 256, with\nresults in Figure 8. Performance improves on both datasets even\nbeyond 64 negative samples, with gains from negative sampling\nsurpassing those from layer increases. This underscores the critical\nrole of negative sampling in enhancing models’ performance.\n6.6 Online A/B Test\nIn a main scenario of Huawei Music, we conducted a 7-day online\nA/B test to evaluate the performance of our new model,FuXi-𝛼, uti-\nlizing 30% of the user traffic.

Specifically, the average number of songs played per user in-\ncreased by 4.67%, while the average listening duration per user rose\nby 5.10%.

Ground-truth item을 전체 아이템 집합에서 순위를 매겨 K=10, 50에 대한 성능을 기본적으로 보고합니다.\n\n6.1.4 파라미터 설정\n제안된 FuXi-𝛼를 Pytorch [38]를 사용하여 구현합니다. 대규모 모델 훈련을 가능하게 하기 위해, Accelerate 라이브러리 [26]를 사용하여 멀티-머신 및 멀티-카드 병렬 처리를 적용합니다. 공정한 비교를 위해 첫 두 데이터셋의 모델 파라미터를 HSTU [72]와 동일하게 유지했지만 레이어 수만 다릅니다. KuaiRand 데이터셋의 경우, hidden dimension을 50으로 설정하고 negative sample 수를 기본적으로 128로 설정했습니다. Optimizer, learning rate 및 weight decay와 같은 다른 모든 파라미터는 HSTU [72]와 일치합니다. 세 데이터셋 모두 embedding dimension 및 self-attention hidden vector dimension이 동일합니다. 기본적인 모델 용량 비교를 위해 레이어 수를 2로 설정했습니다. 또한, 4배 레이어 수(8 레이어)로 확장하여 \"XX-Large\"로 지정하고 scaling 효과를 분석했습니다.\n\n6.2 성능 비교 (RQ1)\n\n6.2.1 공개 데이터셋 성능\n제안된 FuXi-𝛼 및 기본 모델의 전반적인 성능 비교는 표 2에 나와 있습니다. 결과에 따르면 다음 관찰을 할 수 있습니다.\n• 첫째, 생성 모델(i.e., SASRec, LLaMa, HSTU, FuXi-𝛼)는 BPRMF, GRU4Rec 및 NARM과 같은 전통적인 모델보다 뛰어납니다.\n• 두 번째로, FuXi-𝛼는 2개의 레이어만으로도 기본 모델보다 우수한 성능을 보입니다.\n\n[… 길이 제한으로 생략 …]"

          "original": "In our paper, we proposed a novel model called FuXi-𝛼, which\nleverages Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention to enhance the\ninteractions with temporal and positional features, and Multi-stage\nFeed-Forward Networks (MFFNs) to facilitate implicit interactions.\nOur offline and online A/B experiments demonstrate that FuXi-𝛼\nconsistently outperforms prior models, and reveal the effectiveness\nof each component. Additionally, the performance continually im-\nproves while scaling up our model, highlighting its potential for\nlarge-scale recommendation systems. In future work, we plan to\nextend our model to tackle more complex recommendation prob-\nlems, such as multi-behavior and multi-modal recommendations,\nand to apply our model to scenarios involving long sequences.",
          "translated": "결론\n\n본 논문에서 제안한 새로운 모델인 FuXi-𝛼는 적응형 다채널 자기 주의(Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention)를 활용하여 시간적 및 위치적 특징과의 상호작용을 강화하고, 다단계 전송-진출 네트워크(Multi-stage Feed-Forward Networks, MFFNs)를 통해 암묵적인 상호작용을 촉진합니다. 오프라인 및 온라인 A/B 실험을 통해 FuXi-𝛼가 기존 모델들을 일관되게 능가함을 보여주며, 각 구성 요소의 효과를 입증합니다. 또한 모델을 확장함에 따라 성능이 지속적으로 향상됨으로써 대규모 추천 시스템에 대한 잠재력을 강조합니다. 향후 연구에서는 다중 행동(multi-behavior) 및 다중 모달(multi-modal) 추천과 같은 보다 복잡한 추천 문제에 FuXi-𝛼를 적용하고, 긴 시퀀스를 포함하는 시나리오에 적용할 계획입니다."

      "abstract": "By leveraging the expressive power of deep generative models, Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based recommender models have demonstrated competitive performance. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to exhibit overconfidence in their predictive distributions as training progresses. This issue is further exacerbated by two inherent characteristics of collaborative filtering (CF): (1) extreme data sparsity and (2) implicit feedback. Despite its importance, there has been a lack of systematic study into this problem. To fill the gap, this paper explores the above limitations with label smoothing (LS) from both theoretical and empirical aspects. Our extensive analysis demonstrates that overconfidence leads to embedding collapse, where latent representations collapse into a narrow subspace. Furthermore, we investigate the conditions under which LS helps recommendation, and observe that the optimal LS factor decreases proportionally with data sparsity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in VAE-based CF that discovers the relationship between overconfidence and embedding collapse, and highlights the necessity of explicitly addressing them.

      "abstract": "Language models are increasingly being deployed for general problem solving across a wide range of tasks, but are still confined to token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference. This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%.

          "original": "Sequential recommendation aims to predict users’ next interaction\nbased on their historical behavior sequences [22, 43, 52]. Accurate\npredictions improve user experience and drive substantial com-\nmercial value [21, 32, 47]. The training efficiency of recommenda-\ntion models affects their update frequency and service freshness,\nwhile inference efficiency impacts system latency and deployment\ncost [29, 30, 46]. Hence, designing recommendation frameworks\nthat are both effective and efficient is a core challenge.\nRecent advances in generative recommendation models [1, 52,\n55] leverage autoregressive architectures to achieve superior perfor-\nmance and scaling effects compared to traditional methods [16, 22,\narXiv:2512.12740v1  [cs.IR]  14 Dec 2025\n\nKDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju Island, Republic of Korea Dezhi Yi et al.\n43]. However, these models often introduce efficiency bottlenecks\ndue to architectural complexity. For example, although HSTU [55]\nimproves HR@10 by 55.18% over SASRec [ 22], it suffers from a\n3.21× slowdown in training efficiency. FuXi-𝛼 [52] further improves\nHR@10 by 5.66% over HSTU but incurs an additional 9.63% effi-\nciency loss. Such inefficiency forces production systems to reduce\nmodel size to meet latency requirements, weakening the scaling\nbenefits of the autoregressive paradigm.\nA primary efficiency bottleneck in sequential recommendation\nlies in temporal encoding module. Temporal information is essential\nfor capturing the dynamics of user preferences over time, which is\nfundamental to modeling interest patterns [2, 28, 51]. However, tem-\nporal encoders in existing state-of-the-art frameworks often conflict\nwith parallel hardware due to irregular and fragmented memory\naccess, severely limiting computational efficiency. For example,\nboth HSTU [55] and FuXi-𝛼 [52] employ a T5-style bucket-based\nencoding scheme [37], where relative temporal intervals are log-\ntransformed and discretized into distinct indices for bucket lookup.\nThis operation pattern results in 𝑛2 non-contiguous and unstruc-\ntured memory accesses for a sequence of length 𝑛, posing a major\nobstacle to parallel execution on modern hardware. Although FuXi-\n𝛽 [53] introduces an inverse-proportion decay function to alleviate\nsome of these issues, both approaches lack grounding in cognitive\nprinciples, limiting their expressiveness and explainability.\nAnother overlooked inefficiency stems from positional encoding\nmodule. Modern frameworks introduce relative positional encod-\ning even when absolute positional embedding and temporal signal\nare already available. For example, FuXi- 𝛼 [52] and FuXi- 𝛽 [53]\nincorporate positional encoding as a separate attention channel\nwith 𝑂(𝑛 2) complexity, which becomes an efficiency bottleneck\nfor long sequences. Recent advances in block-sparse semantic at-\ntention [8, 20, 27, 50] offer promising solutions, but have yet to be\nexplored in the context of positional attention in recommendation.\nTo address dual challenges of efficiency and effectiveness in mod-\neling user interests, we propose a novel sequential recommenda-\ntion framework named FuXi-𝛾. Building upon FuXi-𝛽 [53], FuXi-𝛾\nadopts an autoregressive architecture with dual attention channels\nfor temporal and positional modeling. We introduce two key innova-\ntions: (1) An exponential-power temporal encoder, inspired by the\nEbbinghaus forgetting curve [5], which models time-aware user in-\nterest decay through a continuous, fully matrix-based formulation.\nThis cognitively motivated design offers strong expressiveness and\nhardware-friendly execution, yielding up to11.00 × speedup over\nthe bucket-based encoder and significant gains in recommendation\nperformance. (2) A diagonal-sparse positional mechanism, which\nidentifies and prunes low-contribution attention blocks based on\nimportance scoring on the leftmost column, reducing positional\nattention overhead by74.56%while preserving recommendation\nquality.

Early methods employ\nprobabilistic models, such as Markov Chains [39] and session-based\nkNN [15, 17], to capture short-term transitions. Subsequent deep\nlearning approaches model higher-order dependencies through\nCNNs [44], RNNs [ 34], and GRU-based architecture [ 16]. With\nthe introduction of Transformer [45], global dependency modeling\nbecomes possible via self-attention. SASRec [22] uses multi-head\nself-attention to identify important items. BERT4Rec [43] leverages\nbidirectional encoding for improved prediction. Further extensions\nexplore more complex settings, including cross-domain [60], multi-\nmodal [57], and multi-behavior scenarios [42].\nTraditional frameworks typically follow a ranking-based for-\nmulation, which limits their scalability and adaptability. Genera-\ntive recommendation reframes the task as sequence generation,\nenabling unified, end-to-end modeling. TIGER [38] pioneers gener-\native recommendation for zero-shot scenarios. HLLM [1] tokenizes\nitem IDs for autoregressive modeling with large language mod-\nels. HSTU [55] scales recommendation using Transformer-based\ngeneration. FuXi-𝛼 [52] introduces a three-channel design to sep-\narately model semantic, temporal, and positional features, while\nFuXi-𝛽[53] improves efficiency by removing semantic modeling.\nDespite recent progress, balancing effectiveness and efficiency\nremains a core challenge. To this end, we propose FuXi- 𝛾 that\nintegrates a cognitively inspired temporal encoder and a sparse\npositional mechanism to improve both performance and scalability.\n2.2 Temporal Encoder\nTemporal information plays a crucial role in capturing the evolving\nnature of user interests. Prior works explore various strategies, such\nas encoder-decoder timestamp modeling [59], joint learning of tem-\nporal patterns [51], and multi-granularity temporal embeddings [2].\nTiSASRec [28] explicitly incorporates both absolute positions and\nrelative temporal intervals. Time2Vec [23] represents temporal sig-\nnals through sinusoidal and linear activations. More recently, gen-\nerative recommendation models like HSTU [55] and FuXi-𝛼 [52]\nadopt T5-style bucket encodings [ 37] to discretize relative tem-\nporal intervals. Despite effectiveness, the bucket-based method\nintroduces discontinuous memory access and poor hardware uti-\nlization, resulting in substantial efficiency bottlenecks, particularly\n\nFuXi-𝛾 KDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju Island, Republic of Korea\nfor long sequences. FuXi-𝛽 [53] replaces bucketing with an inverse-\nproportional decay function, offering improved efficiency. However,\nits fixed decay pattern lacks adaptability across different application\nscenarios, limiting modeling flexibility.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose an exponential-power\ntemporal encoder inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve [5].\nThe design enables flexible modeling of temporal decay patterns and\nmaintains efficient, hardware-friendly continuous memory access.\n2.3 Positional Encoder\nPositional encoding provides contextual information for sequence\nmodeling tasks. Existing approaches can be broadly classified into\nabsolute and relative encoding methods. Absolute encodings di-\nrectly incorporate positional vectors into item representations, typ-\nically implemented using either fixed sinusoidal functions [45] or\nlearnable embeddings [9]. Relative encodings [3, 14, 19, 24, 37, 40]\nmodel pairwise item distances by learning weights associated with\nrelative positional offsets. Recent generative recommendation mod-\nels often combine both encoding types, integrating relative encod-\ning either as an additive bias in the semantic channel [55] or as a\nseparate attention matrix in an independent channel [52, 53].\nFollowing FuXi-𝛼 [52] and FuXi-𝛽 [53], we adopt relative posi-\ntional encoding as a separate attention matrix. However, we observe\nthat positional information is already partially captured by the em-\nbedding layer and the temporal encoder, introducing redundancy.\nTo mitigate this, we design a diagonal-sparse pruning method ap-\nplied after training. This method removes low-contribution blocks\nfrom the positional attention matrix, significantly reducing compu-\ntation overhead while preserving recommendation accuracy.",

          "original": "In this section, we begin by formally defining the next-item sequen-\ntial recommendation task. We then present the overall architecture\nof FuXi-𝛾, followed by a detailed description of its core components.\n3.1 Problem Statement\nThe primary objective of sequential recommendation is to predict\nthe next item a user is likely to interact with, conditioned on their\nhistorical interaction sequence. Formally, letU=\n\b\n𝑢1, 𝑢2, . . . , 𝑢| U |\n\t\ndenote the set of users, and V=\n\b\n𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣| V |\n\t\nthe set of items.\nFor each user𝑢∈ U , the interaction history is represented as a time-\nordered sequence 𝑆𝑢 =\nh\n(𝑣 (𝑢 )\n1 , 𝑡 (𝑢 )\n1 ),(𝑣 (𝑢 )\n2 , 𝑡 (𝑢 )\n2 ), . . . ,(𝑣 (𝑢 )\n𝑛𝑢 , 𝑡 (𝑢 )\n𝑛𝑢 )\ni\n,\nwhere each tuple (𝑣 (𝑢 )\n𝑖 , 𝑡 (𝑢 )\n𝑖 ) corresponds to an item interacted with\nat timestamp 𝑡 (𝑢 )\n𝑖 . The goal is to predict the subsequent item 𝑣 (𝑢 )\n𝑛𝑢 +1\nthat user 𝑢 will interact with, given their historical sequence 𝑆𝑢.\nThis task is typically formulated as estimating the conditional prob-\nability distribution over the item space: 𝑃\n\u0010\n𝑣 (𝑢 )\n𝑛𝑢 +1 =𝑣|𝑆 𝑢\n\u0011\n,∀𝑣∈ V .\nDuring training, the model is optimized to predict the next item𝑣 (𝑢 )\n𝑖+1\nat each position 𝑖 along the sequence 𝑆𝑢. Thus the desired output\nsequence corresponds to\nh\n𝑣 (𝑢 )\n2 , 𝑣 (𝑢 )\n3 , . . . , 𝑣(𝑢 )\n𝑛𝑢 +1\ni\n[22].\n3.2 Overall Architecture\nThe overall architecture of FuXi- 𝛾 is illustrated in Figure 1.

(2) FuXi-𝛾 Block: Capture user\ninterest patterns via dual-channel self-attention layer and SwiGLU\nFFN. (3) Prediction Layer: Computes the probability distribution\nover the item vocabulary for the next-item prediction.\n3.2.1 Embedding Layer.To address the variability in user interac-\ntion sequence lengths, we normalize each user’s interaction history\nto a fixed length 𝑛 prior to the embedding layer. Sequences longer\nthan 𝑛 are truncated, while shorter sequences are padded with a spe-\ncial \"padding item\". Each item 𝑣∈ V is mapped to a 𝑑-dimensional\nvector via a learnable embedding matrix 𝐸∈R | V | ×𝑑. In addition,\nwe incorporate absolute positional information by adding learnable\npositional embeddings. Let 𝑒𝑖 and 𝑝𝑖 denote the item embedding\nand positional embedding of the 𝑖-th position, respectively. For a\nuser sequence𝑆 𝑢, the output of the embedding layer is given by:\n𝑋 0 =\nh\n𝑒 (𝑢)\n1 +𝑝 1, . . . , 𝑒(𝑢)\n𝑛𝑢 +𝑝 𝑛𝑢 ,0, . . . ,0\ni\n,(1)\nwhere vectors0correspond to padding positions from𝑛 𝑢 +1to𝑛.\nThe resulting embedding 𝑋 0 is subsequently passed through a\nstack of FuXi-𝛾 blocks to capture user interest patterns.

To generate the prediction, we project the final hidden\nrepresentation onto the item space by computing dot product with\nthe transpose of input embedding matrix, followed by a softmax\nfunction to obtain a probability distribution over all candidate items:\n𝑃\n\u0010\n𝑣 (𝑢)\n𝑖 =𝑣|\nh\n(𝑣 (𝑢)\n1 , 𝑡 (𝑢)\n1 ), . . . ,(𝑣 (𝑢)\n𝑖−1 , 𝑡 (𝑢)\n𝑖−1 )\ni\u0011\n=Softmax\n\u0010\n𝑥 𝐿𝐸T\n\u0011\n𝑣\n,\n(2)\nwhere 𝑥 𝐿 denotes the final-layer representation at position 𝑖− 1,\nand 𝐸 is the input embedding matrix. To improve training efficiency,\nwe adopt the sampled softmax loss, where the softmax is computed\nover the true item and𝑁randomly sampled negative items [25].\n\nKDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju Island, Republic of Korea Dezhi Yi et al.\n3.3 FuXi-𝛾Block\nFuXi-𝛾 block comprises two components: a dual-channel self-attention\nlayer and a SwiGLU feed-forward network (FFN) [41]. To improve\ntraining stability, we adopt a pre-normalization [10] strategy, ap-\nplying layer normalization before each sub-layer computation.\n3.3.1 Dual-Channel Self-Attention Layer.This layer decouples rep-\nresentation learning into two distinct channels: a temporal channel\nand a positional channel. This design enables each channel’s en-\ncoder to specialize in capturing different aspects of the sequence\ninformation. Then, we adopt a post-mixing strategy via point-wise\ninteraction and linear projection to aggregate signals.\nLet 𝑋∈R 𝑛×𝑑 denote the input embedding to one FuXi-𝛾 block.\nWe first construct two projection representations of input sequence:\n𝑈 , 𝑉=Split(𝜙(RMSNorm(𝑋)𝑊 𝑢𝑣 )),(3)\nwhere RMSNorm denotes root mean square layer normalization [56],\n𝑊𝑢𝑣 ∈R 𝑑×3𝑑 is a learnable matrix, 𝜙 denotes SiLU nonlinear trans-\nformation [6], 𝑈∈R 𝑛×2𝑑 and 𝑉∈R 𝑛×𝑑 are two projected outputs.\nTo simplify computation and improve efficiency, we share 𝑉\nbetween temporal and positional encoders to learn user interests.\nThen the outputs of two encoders are concatenated and mixed with\n𝑈via Hadamard product to enable explicit 2-order interactions:\n𝐼=RMSNorm(Concat(𝐴 𝑡𝑠𝑉 ,𝑊𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑉)) ⊙𝑈 ,(4)\nwhere 𝐴𝑡𝑠 ∈R 𝑛×𝑛 is a temporal attention matrix constructed based\non relative temporal intervals (see Section 3.4.1 for design details);\n𝑊𝑝𝑜𝑠 ∈R 𝑛×𝑛 is a learnable positional encoding matrix, where 𝑊 𝑖,𝑗\n𝑝𝑜𝑠\ndenotes the attention weight for relative positional offset 𝑖−𝑗 and\nsatisfies𝑊 𝑖,𝑗\n𝑝𝑜𝑠 =𝑊 𝑖+𝑚,𝑗+𝑚\n𝑝𝑜𝑠 , i.e.,𝑊 𝑝𝑜𝑠 is a Toeplitz matrix.\nFinally, we pass the interaction result𝐼∈R 𝑛×2𝑑 through a linear\nlayer to aggregate temporal and positional signals, and introduce a\nresidual connection [13] to maintain original sequence information:\n𝑂=𝐼𝑊 𝑜 +𝑏+𝑋 ,(5)\nwhere𝑊 𝑜 ∈R 2𝑑×𝑑 and𝑏∈R 𝑑 are learnable parameters.\n3.3.2 SwiGLU FFN.Each dual-channel self-attention layer is fol-\nlowed by a SwiGLU FFN, which further refines the representation\nthrough implicit interactions. To preserve the flow of gradients and\nenable deep modeling, we incorporate a residual connection around\nthe FFN. The computations are formally defined as:\n𝑂 ′ =RMSNorm(𝑂),\n𝐻=(𝜙(𝑂 ′𝑊1) ⊙ (𝑂 ′𝑊2))𝑊3 +𝑂, (6)\nwhere 𝜙 is SiLU activation, 𝑊1,𝑊 2 ∈R 𝑑×𝑑 FFN and 𝑊3 ∈R 𝑑FFN ×𝑑 are\nlearnable weights,𝐻∈R 𝑛×𝑑 is the final output of FuXi-𝛾block.\n3.4 Exponential-Power Temporal Encoder\nEffectively and efficiently capturing the evolving nature of user\ninterests over time is a key challenge. To address this problem,\nwe propose an exponential-power temporal encoder that utilizes\na continuous and tunable decay mechanism, offering both strong\nmodeling capabilities and high computational efficiency.\n3.4.1 Algorithm Design.Motivated by the intuition that recent in-\nteractions better reflect users’ current interests, we impose a mono-\ntonic decay pattern on temporal attention weights: smaller tempo-\nral intervals receive higher weights, while larger intervals receive\nlower weights. Inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve [ 5],\nwhich describes human memory decays exponentially over time,\nwe adopt a tunable exponential function to model the temporal\ndecay in user preferences. First, we represent temporal intervals\nwithin a user’s interaction sequence as pairwise differences be-\ntween item timestamps. Specifically, we construct a relative tem-\nporal matrix 𝑇∈N 𝑛×𝑛 for each sequence, where 𝑇 𝑖,𝑗 denotes the\nabsolute difference between the timestamps of the 𝑖-th and 𝑗-th\nitems: 𝑇 𝑖,𝑗 =|𝑡 𝑖 −𝑡 𝑗 |. To reduce computation and memory cost,\nthis preprocessing is performed only once, and the resulting 𝑇 is\nshared across all temporal encoders. Then, we apply a nonlinear\ntransformation to 𝑇 using a power function. This design prevents\ninsufficient learning of long-term user preferences that can occur\nwhen excessively long temporal intervals produce very weak sig-\nnals. Finally, we adopt an exponential function to model the decay\nof user interests over time. Formally, the temporal attention matrix\n𝐴𝑡𝑠 ∈R 𝑛×𝑛 used in Section 3.3.1 is defined as:\n𝐴𝑡𝑠 =𝛼·𝛾 𝑇 𝛽\n,i.e.,𝐴 𝑖,𝑗\n𝑡𝑠 =𝛼·𝛾 |𝑡𝑖 −𝑡 𝑗 |𝛽\n, 𝛾∈ (0,1),(7)\nwhere 𝛼∈R is a learnable parameter representing the base interest\nintensity, 𝛽∈R is a learnable parameter controlling the nonlinear-\nity of scaling transformation, and 𝛾∈ ( 0, 1) is a decay parameter\nthat governs the rate of interest attenuation. A smaller 𝛾 induces\nfaster decay, emphasizing short-term patterns, whereas a larger\n𝛾 preserves more long-term signals. This design offers flexibility\nacross diverse user behaviors and application scenarios, enabling\nthe model to capture both short-term and long-term preferences in\na simple yet expressive manner.\n3.4.2 Pre-Conversion of Data Type.In Equation 7, the parameters\n𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝛾 are represented in float32, while the relative temporal\nmatrix 𝑇 is originally in int64. Due to the inconsistency of data\ntypes, computing 𝑇 𝛽 implicitly introduces type casting at runtime,\nwhich incurs additional time overhead and becomes more costly\nwhen repeated across multiple layers. To mitigate this issue, we ex-\nplicitly cast 𝑇 to float32 during preprocessing. This pre-conversion\nensures that all subsequent operations, such as power and exponen-\ntial calculations, are performed using the same data type, thereby\navoiding runtime casting and improving computational efficiency.\nThis simple optimization brings notable performance gains: (1) The\nexecution time of our exponential-power temporal encoder is re-\nduced by 64.82%. (2) Overall FuXi-𝛾 achieves an additional 12.61%\nspeedup and 5.08% reduction in memory usage during training, and\na 15.53% speedup and 6.98% memory reduction during inference.\n3.4.3 Analysis.Our proposed exponential-power temporal encoder\nachieves strong performance in both architectural compatibility\nand computational efficiency (see Section 4.3 for details). Existing\nbucket-based method, as used in HSTU [55] and FuXi-𝛼 [52], ap-\nplies logarithmic transformations to temporal intervals and then\nmaps them into discrete indices for bucket lookup. Although this\napproach offers some modeling flexibility, it suffers from several\nkey limitations: (1) The design does not reflect how user interests\nevolve over time. (2) Coarse-grained discretization leads to a loss of\n\nFuXi-𝛾 KDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju Island, Republic of Korea\ndetail, as different temporal intervals may fall into the same bucket.\n(3) Most importantly, the irregular memory access during bucket\nlookup creates a critical efficiency bottleneck, especially when han-\ndling long sequences. FuXi-𝛽 [53] proposes an inverse-proportion\nfunction to represent temporal decay, which helps reduce memory\naccess overhead and partly captures interest attenuation. However,\nit lacks adaptability due to the untunable decay pattern, which\noverly favors recent interactions and limits flexibility in modeling\nlonger-term user preferences. In contrast, our exponential-power\nencoder is inspired by cognitive memory theory and operates en-\ntirely through standard matrix computations. This design enables\nmore accurate modeling of adaptive-range interests and ensures\nsmooth and efficient execution on modern hardware.\n3.5 Diagonal-Sparse Positional Mechanism\nPositional information is explicitly encoded in the embedding layer\nand implicitly reflected through temporal signals. Therefore, we\nidentify and prune redundant weights in relative positional at-\ntention, further enhancing the inference performance of FuXi- 𝛾.\nSpecifically, we design the diagonal-sparse positional mechanism,\nwhich consists of three steps: (1) Block-level division of the po-\nsitional attention map. (2) Importance scoring of each block. (3)\nSelection of important blocks for sparse attention computation.\nBlock Division Leftmost Scoring Diagonal-sliding Selection Block Sparse Attention\nFigure 2: Illustration of diagonal-sparse positional mecha-\nnism. In this example, sequence length 𝑛= 8, stride size 𝑠= 2,\nand configured pruning ratio 𝜏= 50%. Red Blocks are pruned\ndue to lower importance scores. Only the remaining green\nblocks participate in positional attention computation.\n3.5.1 Block Division.Element-level unstructured pruning offers\naccuracy advantages but incurs considerable overhead in hardware\ndeployment. Row-level and column-level structured pruning are\nmore hardware-friendly but may overlook critical sparse patterns,\nleading to degraded accuracy [48]. To balance trade-off, we adopt\nblock-level semi-structured pruning strategy to retain accuracy\nand improve deployability. Specifically, we partition the positional\nattention map into several blocks of size𝑠×𝑠 , where𝑠 is configurable\nstride size. To accommodate sequences whose length 𝑛 can not be\ndivisible by 𝑠, we apply zero-padding to the top and right edges of\nattention map until the dimension becomes divisible. Since FuXi-𝛾\nadopts a decoder-only architecture, the upper-triangular region\nof the attention map is masked with 0. Therefore, our padding\noperation does not damage the original meaningful information.\n3.5.2 Leftmost Importance Scoring.An effective scoring method\nshould robustly identify the high-utility regions of attention map\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. To this end, we pro-\npose the leftmost scoring method as shown in Figure 2. Given that\nattention map reflects contribution through weighted summation,\nwe use the sum of absolute values within each block as a proxy for\nimportance. To reduce computation, we utilize the persymmetry of\nToeplitz matrix: 𝑊 𝑖,𝑗\n𝑝𝑜𝑠 =𝑊 𝑖+𝑚,𝑗+𝑚\n𝑝𝑜𝑠 , as established in Section 3.3.1.\nThis means all blocks lying on the same diagonal share identical\nvalues. Consequently, it suffices to compute importance scores only\nfor the blocks in the leftmost column, each of which uniquely rep-\nresents one diagonal slice of the entire map. Our scoring method\nis effective for two key reasons: (1) Coverage Guarantee: Since\neach positional weight is included in at least one leftmost block, the\nscoring process ensures full coverage of attention weights. (2) Struc-\ntural Awareness: The leftmost column intersects with all slash-like\npatterns (i.e., diagonals), enabling efficient detection of meaningful\nstructures and guiding sparse attention accordingly.\n3.5.3 Diagonal-Sliding Selection.Based on importance scores, we\npropose a diagonal-sliding block selection method to generate the\nfinal sparse attention mask. The formal algorithm is summarized\nin Algorithm 1. Let 𝑛 denote the sequence length, 𝑠 the configured\nstride size, and 𝜏∈ [ 0, 1] the configured pruning ratio. After esti-\nmating the importance scores of 𝑛\n𝑠 leftmost blocks, we identify the\ntop-𝑘 most unimportant blocks, where 𝑘=\n\u0004 𝑛\n𝑠 ·𝜏\n\u0005\n. Then, we slide\nthese identified blocks diagonally across the entire attention map to\ngenerate final sparse mask. This overall sparsity mechanism effec-\ntively and efficiently identifies and prunes redundant blocks within\nthe positional attention map in a diagonally structured manner.\nAlgorithm 1:Diagonal-Sliding Sparse Mask Generation\nInput: Positional attention map 𝑊𝑝𝑜𝑠 ∈R 𝑛×𝑛 ; Stride size 𝑠; Pruning ratio 𝜏\nOutput:Sparse mask𝑀\n1Block Division:\n2𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠← 𝑛\n𝑠\n3𝑙𝑒 𝑓 𝑡𝑚𝑜𝑠𝑡_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠←𝑊 𝑝𝑜𝑠 [:,:𝑠].view(𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠, 𝑠, 𝑠)\n4Leftmost Importance Scoring:\n5𝑎𝑏𝑠_𝑠𝑢𝑚←sum( |𝑙𝑒 𝑓 𝑡𝑚𝑜𝑠𝑡_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠|,dim=(2,3) )\n6𝑚𝑎𝑥_𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥←𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠×𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠−1\n7𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘← ⌊𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠×𝜏⌋\n8_, 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠_𝑡𝑜_𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘←TopK(𝑎𝑏𝑠_𝑠𝑢𝑚,k=𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘,largest=False)\n9𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙_𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠←𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠_𝑡𝑜_𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘×𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠\n10Diagonal-Sliding Selection:\n11𝑀← [ ]\n12𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡←𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠+1\n13foreach𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥∈𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙_𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠do\n14while𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥≤𝑚𝑎𝑥_𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥do\n15𝑀 .append(𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥)\n16𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥←𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥+𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡\n17end\n18end\n19return𝑀",

The statistics of the processed datasets are shown in Table 1.\n• MovieLens[ 12]: This is a widely used benchmark dataset for\nevaluating recommendation algorithms. The dataset includes\nusers’ rating and tagging activities. In this paper, we adopt two\nwell-established versions for our experiments, i.e., MovieLens-\n1M (ML-1M1) and MovieLens-20M (ML-20M2).\n• KuaiRand[ 7]: The dataset3 is collected from sequential interac-\ntion logs of Kuaishou, a prominent short-video sharing mobile\napplication. This platform shows high engagement, averaging\n50+ interactions per active user.\n• Industrial: This dataset is constructed from the user records of\nan industrial mainstream music app, which has tens of millions\nof active users every month. This complex dataset can better\nevaluate the robustness and effectiveness of models.\n4.1.2 Baselines.For a competitive comparison, we evaluate FuXi- 𝛾\nagainst a broad set of representative baselines spanning diverse ar-\nchitectures, including LinRec [33], FLASH [18], GRU4Rec [16], SAS-\nRec [22], LRURec [54], Mamba4Rec [31], LLaMa [10], HSTU [55],\nFuXi-𝛼 [52], and FuXi- 𝛽 [53]. These baselines collectively cover\nthe key and efficient paradigms in modern sequential recommen-\ndation, such as RNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based\narchitectures, ensuring a fair and comprehensive evaluation.\n4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics.We employ three well-established eval-\nuation metrics to evaluate recommendation performance: Hit Ra-\ntio (HR), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and\nMean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) [52, 55]. HR@K measures whether\nthe ground-truth item appears within the top-K positions of the\nrecommendation list. NDCG@K evaluates top-K recommendation\nquality by assigning higher scores to relevant items ranked closer\n1https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/\n2https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/\n3https://kuairand.com/\nto the top. MRR evaluates the ranking quality by computing the\nreciprocal rank of the first relevant item in the recommendation\nresults. For all these metrics, higher values indicate better recom-\nmendation performance. Following common practice [52, 53], we\nreport HR@K and NDCG@K with K = 10, 50 by default.\n4.1.4 Implementation Details.We implement FuXi- 𝛾 using Py-\nTorch4. For fair comparison, all models share the same hyper-\nparameter settings, primarily following FuXi-𝛼 [52] and FuXi-𝛽 [53].\nSpecifically, we use the AdamW optimizer [35] with a learning rate\nof 0.001 and a batch size of 128. The hidden dimensions are set to\n50, 64, 256, and 256 for ML-1M, KuaiRand, ML-20M, and Industrial\ndatasets, respectively. The dropout rate is set to 0.2, and the num-\nber of negative samples is set to 128. For our FuXi-𝛾, the temporal\nencoder’s decay parameter𝛾 is set to 0.8 for movie and video scenar-\nios, and 0.9 for music. This setting reflects the intuition that music\nconsumption typically exhibits stronger long-term user preferences,\nthus requiring a slower decay rate to preserve long-range interest\nsignals, whereas movie/video interactions are more sensitive to\nrecent behaviors. To evaluate base modeling capacity, we set the\nnumber of layers to 2. To analyze scaling effects, we extend the\nmodels to 8 layers (i.e., 4× deeper) and denote the variants as \"XX-\nLarge\". For the Industrial dataset, we adopt 4 layers, consistent with\nthe deployed online model. To enable efficient large-scale training,\nwe utilize multi-NPU parallelism via the Accelerate library [26].\n4.2 Overall Performance\n4.2.1 Recommendation Performance on Public Datasets.As shown\nin Table 2, we summarize the key observations as follows:\n• Our proposed FuXi-𝛾 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines across all datasets. Under the 8-layer configuration,\nFuXi-𝛾 surpasses other autoregressive models by an average of\n4https://pytorch.org/\n\nFuXi-𝛾 KDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju Island, Republic of Korea\n3.79% in HR@10, 2.37% in HR@50, 4.46% in NDCG@10, 3.49% in\nNDCG@50, and 4.24% in MRR. Even with shallow 2-layer con-\nfiguration, FuXi-𝛾 still achieves the best or second-best perfor-\nmance, demonstrating its strong ability to capture user interest\npatterns. Notably, our proposed exponential-power temporal\nencoder contributes meaningfully to this improvement. An in-\ndepth study of this module is provided in Section 4.3.\n• Generative models based on autoregressive architectures overall\noutperform the traditional methods, which aligns with previous\nfindings [11, 49, 52, 53, 55]. For example, increasing the depth of\nGRU4Rec or SASRec from 2 to 8 layers results in performance\ndegradation, indicating that traditional architectures struggle\nto model complex item dependencies. In contrast, generative\nmodels exhibit strong scaling effects, highlighting their potential\nfor more expressive sequence recommendation modeling.\n• Our FuXi-𝛾 achieves excellent inference efficiency, surpassed\nonly by LinRec on ML-20M. The efficiency gains primarily stem\nfrom three factors: (1) Nearly pure matrix-based architecture:\nEach FuXi-𝛾 block consists almost entirely of hardware-friendly\nmatrix operations, enabling high hardware utilization. (2) Min-\nimalistic single-head attention: FuXi-𝛾 employs no query-key\nattention and no multi-head expansion, avoiding the costly pro-\njections, scaling operations, activations, head-wise computa-\ntions, and tensor-splitting overheads typical of Transformers.\n(3) Efficient temporal encoder: The exponential-power temporal\nencoder relies on continuous matrix operations rather than dis-\ncrete bucket lookups, eliminating irregular memory access. Fur-\nther evaluation of efficiency against strong generative baselines\nacross varying sequence lengths is provided in Section 4.2.4.\nTable 3: Overall recommendation performance comparison\non the industrial dataset.

Compared with other autoregressive\nbaselines, it achieves25.06%higher HR@10 and42.86%higher\nNDCG@10 on average. Against the strongest baseline FuXi-𝛽, our\nFuXi-𝛾 achieves gains of 6.97% in HR@10, 1.74% in HR@50, 12.13%\nin NDCG@10, 9.25% in NDCG@50, and 13.70% in MRR. These re-\nsults further demonstrate that FuXi-𝛾 generalizes well in various\napplication scenarios, benefiting from our temporal encoder that\nadaptively models both long-term and short-term user interests.\n4.2.3 Ablation Study.Table 4 reports the results of ablation studies\non the three public datasets. Among all components, our proposed\nexponential-power temporal encoder proves to be the most critical.\nIt allows the model to assign differentiated weights to items based\non time intervals, effectively capturing the temporal evolution of\nuser preferences. The positional encoder contributes moderately.\nSince item representations already incorporate absolute positional\nembeddings, and temporal information implicitly encodes sequen-\ntial order, the relative positional channel provides marginal yet\ncomplementary gains. The SwiGLU FFN’s impact is relatively mi-\nnor, suggesting that FuXi-𝛾’s dual-channel self-attention layer suf-\nficiently models sequence dependencies. Nevertheless, its implicit\ninteraction provides a minor boost to model expressiveness.\nTable 4: Ablation study based on FuXi-𝛾.\nSetting ML-1M ML-20M KuaiRand\nHR@10 NG@10HR@10 NG@10HR@10 NG@10\nFuXi-𝛾 0.3423 0.1975 0.3588 0.2135 0.1137 0.0571\nw/o SwiGLU FFN0.3361 0.1931 0.3496 0.2059 0.1117 0.0570\nw/o Positional Encoder0.3281 0.1865 0.3548 0.2096 0.1113 0.0559\nw/o Temporal Encoder0.3120 0.1767 0.3248 0.1882 0.1043 0.0521\n4.2.4 Efficiency Performance.Having established the effectiveness\nof FuXi-𝛾, we now evaluate its computational efficiency across\nvarying sequence lengths. Comparisons are made against other\nautoregressive generative models, which uniformly outperform\ntraditional baselines in both accuracy and scaling effects. We report\nresults on KuaiRand, with consistent trends observed across other\ndatasets. (1) Training Efficiency: As shown in Figure 3(a), FuXi-𝛾\nstably achieves the highest training efficiency across all sequence\nlengths, with its advantage growing more pronounced at longer\nsequences. At a length of 1000, it achieves speedups of4.74×, 4.48×,\nand 1.86× over LLaMa, HSTU, and FuXi-𝛽, respectively. Notably,\nFuXi-𝛼 encounters out-of-memory (OOM) issue at this scale, due to\nits computationally intensive three-channel architecture. (2) Infer-\nence Efficiency: Figure 3(b) further demonstrates FuXi-𝛾’s leading\ninference efficiency, with the performance gap similarly widen-\ning at longer sequence lengths. At length 1000, FuXi- 𝛾 achieves\ninference speedups of6.18 ×, 6.07×, and 2.24× over LLaMa, HSTU,\nand FuXi-𝛽, respectively. These results underscore FuXi-𝛾’s strong\nscalability and practical suitability for long-sequence recommen-\ndation, attributed to its streamlined dual-channel architecture and\nlightweight exponential-power temporal encoder.\n/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni0000001b/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013\n/uni00000030/uni00000044/uni0000005b/uni0000004c/uni00000050/uni00000058/uni00000050/uni00000003/uni00000036/uni00000048/uni00000054/uni00000058/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000046/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni0000002f/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni0000004a/uni00000057/uni0000004b\n/uni00000013\n/uni00000014/uni0000001b\n/uni00000016/uni00000019\n/uni00000018/uni00000017\n/uni0000001a/uni00000015\n/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000056/uni00000012/uni00000048/uni00000053/uni00000052/uni00000046/uni0000004b\n/uni0000002f/uni0000002f/uni00000044/uni00000030/uni00000044\n/uni0000002b/uni00000036/uni00000037/uni00000038\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\nOOM\n(a) Training Efficiency\n/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni0000001b/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013\n/uni00000030/uni00000044/uni0000005b/uni0000004c/uni00000050/uni00000058/uni00000050/uni00000003/uni00000036/uni00000048/uni00000054/uni00000058/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000046/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni0000002f/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni0000004a/uni00000057/uni0000004b\n/uni00000013\n/uni0000001a\n/uni00000014/uni00000017\n/uni00000015/uni00000014\n/uni00000015/uni0000001b/uni0000002c/uni00000051/uni00000049/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000046/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni0000002f/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000046/uni0000005c/uni00000003/uni0000000b/uni0000005b/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000003/uni00000056/uni0000000c\n/uni0000002f/uni0000002f/uni00000044/uni00000030/uni00000044\n/uni0000002b/uni00000036/uni00000037/uni00000038\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\nOOM (b) Inference Efficiency\nFigure 3: Overall efficiency performance comparison.\n4.3 Study of Temporal Encoder\n4.3.1 Compatibility.As shown in Table 5, we evaluate the com-\npatibility of different temporal encoders by integrating them into\nthree representative state-of-the-art architectures.

This\nperformance gain stems from its alignment with human memory\ndecay patterns via exponential modeling. In addition, the temporal\nencoders used in HSTU, FuXi-𝛼, and FuXi-𝛽 also lead to varying\ndegrees of improvement, reaffirming the critical role of temporal\nmodeling in sequential recommendation task.\n4.3.2 Efficiency.Figure 4 presents a comparative analysis of the\ncomputational efficiency of our exponential-power temporal en-\ncoder against two strong baselines. Across all sequence lengths, our\nencoder achieves the lowest latency, owing to its continuous mem-\nory access pattern, lightweight computation, and pre-conversion of\ndata type. In contrast, bucket-based encoder (e.g., adopted by HSTU\nand FuXi-𝛼) exhibits severe degradation in efficiency as sequence\nlength increases. This is primarily due to their discontinuous mem-\nory addressing, which is fundamentally incompatible with modern\nparallel hardware architectures. Although FuXi-𝛽 improves upon\nthis with an inverse-proportional decay function, it still falls short\nof our method. At a sequence length of 1000, our encoder achieves\n11.00× and 2.52× speedup over two baselines, respectively. Fur-\nthermore, while the latency of all encoders scales proportionally\nwith batch size, ours reliably maintains superior efficiency.\n4.3.3 Visualization.Figure 5 illustrates the encoding patterns of\ndifferent temporal encoders.

In contrast, our FuXi-𝛾 generates a smooth, continuous\ndecay curve, thanks to its exponential-power function design.

We evaluate its effects on\nboth effectiveness and efficiency across three representative sce-\nnarios: ML-20M (movie), KuaiRand (video), and Industrial (music).\n4.4.1 Impact of Configured Pruning Ratio 𝜏.As shown in Figure 7,\non ML-20M, increasing the pruning ratio 𝜏 leads to a mild and ac-\nceptable accuracy drop. Even at𝜏= 60%, FuXi-𝛾 retains 98.92% of its\noriginal accuracy, still outperforming the strongest competing base-\nline. Meanwhile, the FLOPs of positional attention are reduced by\n74.56%, highlighting substantial computational savings. As shown\nin Figure 8, on KuaiRand, we observe a slight accuracy improve-\nment at moderate sparsity levels, suggesting that pruning redun-\ndant attention blocks can even enhance generalization. At 𝜏= 60%,\nNDCG@10 decreases by only 0.53%, while FLOPs are reduced by\n70.68%. As shown in Figure 12 in Appendix C, on Industrial, the\nsparsity mechanism incurs almost no accuracy loss, substantially\nimproving its deployability. These results confirm that our semi-\nstructured pruning method effectively eliminates redundancy in\npositional attention while retaining critical information.\n4.4.2 Impact of Stride Size 𝑠.Table 6 summarizes the effect of vary-\ning stride size 𝑠 on accuracy and parameter density, using ML-20M\nas a representative dataset. The results show that 𝑠= 8offers the\nbest trade-off, achieving strong accuracy with relatively low param-\neter density.

In contrast, larger 𝑠\nresults in coarse-grained blocks, which reduces the effectiveness of\nsparsity and may fail to capture fine-grained redundancy. Thus, the\nstride size should be adaptively selected based on the deployment\ncontext to balance accuracy, density, and efficiency.\n4.4.3 Impact of Sequence Length 𝑛.Figure 9 summarizes the robust-\nness of our sparsity mechanism across different sequence lengths,\nusing ML-20M as a representative dataset. The results show that\nthe method remains uniformly stable: even at 𝜏= 60%, FuXi-𝛾\npreserves over 98.65% of its original accuracy, and the performance\ndrop further diminishes as the sequences become longer. This trend\nsuggests that longer input sequences may contain higher redun-\ndancy in positional interactions, making them more amenable to\npruning. Consequently, our pruning method holds greater potential\nfor practical deployment in long-sequence recommender systems.",

Our FuXi-𝛾 introduces\ntwo core innovations: Exponential-Power Temporal Encoder and\nDiagonal-Sparse Positional Mechanism. Exponential-power tempo-\nral encoder is inspired by cognitive memory theory and involves\nonly standard matrix operations, enabling it to flexibly capture both\nshort-term and long-term user interests while ensuring efficient exe-\ncution on modern hardware. Diagonal-sparse positional mechanism\nemploys a diagonally semi-structured manner to effectively identify\nand prune redundant attention blocks, thereby reducing compu-\ntational cost while preserving recommendation quality. Extensive\nexperiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our pro-\nposed FuXi-𝛾 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in\nboth recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency. In\nfuture work, we plan to further improve the efficiency and extend\nthe framework to capture more complex user behavior patterns.",

FuXi-𝛾는 핵심적인 두 가지 혁신을 도입합니다. 첫째, 지각적 기억 이론에서 영감을 얻은 지수-거듭제곱 시간 인코더(Exponential-Power Temporal Encoder)는 표준 행렬 연산만을 사용하여 단기 및 장기 사용자 관심사를 유연하게 포착하면서 현대 하드웨어에서 효율적인 실행을 보장합니다. 둘째, 대각-희소 위치 메커니즘(Diagonal-Sparse Positional Mechanism)은 대각 반정형 방식으로 작동하여 중복된 어텐션 블록을 효과적으로 식별하고 제거함으로써 계산 비용을 줄이면서 추천 품질을 유지합니다. 실제 데이터 세트 4개를 활용한 광범위한 실험 결과, 제안된 FuXi-𝛾가 추천 정확도 및 계산 효율성 측면에서 최신 기술 수준의 기반 모델들을 지속적으로 능가함을 보여줍니다. 향후 연구에서는 효율성을 더욱 개선하고 프레임워크를 확장하여 더욱 복잡한 사용자 행동 패턴을 포착하는 것을 목표로 합니다."

Its derivative is\n𝑓 ′ (𝑥)=𝛼 𝛽(ln𝛾)𝑥 𝛽−1 𝛾𝑥 𝛽\n.(9)\nWhen0 <𝛽< 1, the term𝑥 𝛽−1 =𝑥 − (1−𝛽) diverges as 𝑥→ 0, violat-\ning Lipschitz continuity and potentially introducing optimization\ninstability. To maintain Lipschitz continuity and improve training\nrobustness in this regime, a simple yet effective solution is to shift\nthe input by a small positive constant, replacing𝑥 with 𝑥+𝜖(𝜖> 0).\nB Analysis of Cold-Start & Sparse-Case\nCold-start users and long-tail items are fundamental sparsity chal-\nlenges in real-world recommendation systems. To further assess\nthe robustness of FuXi-𝛾, we evaluate model performance under\nthree challenging conditions: (1) cold-start users with very limited\ninteraction histories, (2) fresh items launched within short time\nwindows, and (3) long-tail items with low exposure frequency.\nB.1 Cold-Start Users\nWe partition the industrial dataset into five groups according to\nusers’ historical interaction lengths. As shown in Figure 10, our\nFuXi-𝛾 robustly outperforms all baselines across all user groups,\nincluding cold-start users with extremely short sequences. The\nperformance gap becomes even larger for long-sequence users,\nindicating that the tunable exponential-power temporal encoder ef-\nfectively captures both short-term and long-term interest patterns.\n/uni00000014/uni00000061/uni00000018/uni00000019/uni00000061/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000015/uni00000014/uni00000061/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni00000018/uni00000014/uni00000061/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000021/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013\n/uni00000036/uni00000048/uni00000054/uni00000058/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000046/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni0000002f/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni0000004a/uni00000057/uni0000004b/uni00000003/uni00000052/uni00000049/uni00000003/uni00000038/uni00000056/uni00000048/uni00000055\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000016/uni0000001c\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni00000016\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni0000001a\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000014\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000018\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000001c/uni0000002b/uni00000035/uni00000023/uni00000014/uni00000013\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\n(a) HR@10 on Industrial\n/uni00000014/uni00000061/uni00000018/uni00000019/uni00000061/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000015/uni00000014/uni00000061/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni00000018/uni00000014/uni00000061/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000021/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013\n/uni00000036/uni00000048/uni00000054/uni00000058/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000046/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni0000002f/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni0000004a/uni00000057/uni0000004b/uni00000003/uni00000052/uni00000049/uni00000003/uni00000038/uni00000056/uni00000048/uni00000055\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni00000015\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni00000019\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000016/uni00000013\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000016/uni00000017\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000016/uni0000001b\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni00000015/uni00000031/uni0000002a/uni00000023/uni00000014/uni00000013\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\n/uni00000029/uni00000058/uni0000003b/uni0000004c/uni00000010\n (b) NDCG@10 on Industrial\nFigure 10: Analysis of cold-start users on Industrial.\nB.2 Fresh Items\nWe examine the model’s ability to recommend fresh items, which\nlack sufficient historical feedback and are often difficult for models\nto rank accurately.

Mamba’s advantage typically emerges\nfor very long sequences (e.g., >2k), while for shorter sequences its\nefficiency is often lower than that of Transformers [4, 36]. The rea-\nson is that achieving linear scaling relies on recurrent state updates,\nwhich introduce non-negligible constant computational overhead.\nIn particular, each state update involves complex operations such\nas matrix multiplications, gating mechanisms, and discretization,\nrequiring additional kernel launches and memory synchronization.\nThese operations exhibit limited parallelism, preventing full uti-\nlization of AI accelerators. Consequently, although Mamba avoids\nthe 𝑂(𝑛 2) attention cost, its low hardware parallelism and large\nconstant factors reduce efficiency for typical sequence lengths.",

DLRMs are char-\nacterized by their usage of heterogeneous features, such as\nnumerical features – counters and ratios, embeddings, and\ncategorical features such as creator ids, user ids, etc. Due\nto new content and products being added every minute, the\nfeature space is of extreme high cardinality, often in the\nrange of billions (Eksombatchai et al., 2018). To leverage\ntens of thousands of such features, DLRMs employ various\nneural networks to combine features, transform intermediate\nrepresentations, and compose the final outputs.\nDespite utilizing extensive human-engineered feature sets\nand training on vast amounts of data, most DLRMs in in-\ndustry scale poorly with compute (Zhao et al., 2023). This\nlimitation is noteworthy and remains unanswered.\nInspired by the success achieved by Transformers in lan-\nguage and vision, we revisit fundamental design choices in\nmodern recommendation systems. We observe that alter-\nnative formulations at billion-user scale need to overcome\nthree challenges. First, features in recommendation systems\nlack explicit structures. While sequential formulations have\nbeen explored in small-scale settings (detailed discussions\n1\narXiv:2402.17152v3  [cs.LG]  6 May 2024\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nin Appendix B), heterogeneous features, including high\ncardinality ids, cross features, counters, ratios, etc. play\ncritical roles in industry-scale DLRMs (Mudigere et al.,\n2022). Second, recommendation systems use billion-scale\nvocabularies that change continuously. A billion-scale dy-\nnamic vocabulary, in contrast to 100K-scale static ones in\nlanguage (Brown et al., 2020), creates training challenges\nand necessitates high inference cost given the need to con-\nsider tens of thousands of candidates in a target-aware fash-\nion (Zhou et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020). Finally, com-\nputational cost represents the main bottleneck in enabling\nlarge-scale sequential models. GPT-3 was trained on a total\nof 300B tokens over a period of 1-2 months with thousands\nof GPUs (Brown et al., 2020). This scale appears daunting,\nuntil we contrast it with the scale of user actions. The largest\ninternet platforms serve billions of daily active users, who\nengage with billions of posts, images, and videos per day.\nUser sequences could be of length up to 105 (Chang et al.,\n2023). Consequentially, recommendation systems need to\nhandle a few orders of magnitude more tokens per day than\nwhat language models process over 1-2 months.\nIn this work, we treat user actions as a new modality in gen-\nerative modeling. Our key insights are, a) core ranking and\nretrieval tasks in industrial-scale recommenders can be cast\nas generative modeling problems given an appropriate new\nfeature space; b) this paradigm enables us to systematically\nleverage redundancies in features, training, and inference\nto improve efficiency. Due to our new formulation, we\ndeployed models that are three orders of magnitude more\ncomputationally complex than prior state-of-the-art, while\nimproving topline metrics by 12.4%, as shown in Figure 1.\nOur contributions are as follows. We first propose Gener-\native Recommenders (GRs) in Section 2, a new paradigm\nreplacing DLRMs. We sequentialize and unify the hetero-\ngeneous feature space in DLRMs, with the new approach\napproximating the full DLRM feature space as sequence\nlength tends to infinity. This enables us to reformulate the\nmain recommendation problems, ranking and retrieval, as\npure sequential transduction tasks in GRs. Importantly, this\nfurther enables model training to be done in a sequential,\ngenerative fashion, which permits us to train on orders of\nmagnitude more data with the same amount of compute.\nWe next address computational cost challenges through-\nout training and inference. We propose a new sequential\ntransduction architecture, Hierarchical Sequential Trans-\nduction Units (HSTU). HSTU modifies attention mecha-\nnism for large, non-stationary vocabulary, and exploits char-\nacteristics of recommendation datasets to achieve 5.3x to\n15.2x speedup vs FlashAttention2-based Transformers on\n8192 length sequences. Further, through a new algorithm,\nM-FALCON, that fully amortizes computational costs via\nmicro-batching (Section 3.4), we can serve 285x more com-\nplex GR models while achieving 1.50x-2.99x speedups, all\nwith the same inference budget used by traditional DLRMs.\nWe finally validate the proposed techniques over synthetic\ndatasets, public datasets, and deployments on multiple sur-\nfaces of a large internet platform with billions of daily ac-\ntive users in Section 4. To the best of our knowledge, our\nwork represents the first result that shows pure sequential\ntransduction-based architectures, like HSTU, in generative\nsettings (GRs) to significantly outperform DLRMs in large-\nscale industrial settings. Remarkably, not only did we over-\ncome known scaling bottlenecks in traditional DLRMs, we\nfurther succeeded in showing that scaling law (Kaplan et al.,\n2020) applies to recommendations, representing the poten-\ntial ChatGPT moment for recommendation systems.\n2. Recommendation as Sequential\nTransduction Tasks: From DLRMs to GRs\n2.1. Unifying heterogeneous feature spaces in DLRMs\nModern DLRM models are usually trained with a vast num-\nber of categorical (‘sparse’) and numerical (‘dense’) fea-\ntures. In GRs, we consolidate and encode these features into\na single unified time series, as depicted in Figure 2.\nCategorical (‘sparse’) features. Examples of such fea-\ntures include items that user liked, creators in a category\n(e.g., Outdoors) that user is following, user languages, com-\nmunities that user joined, cities from which requests were\ninitiated, etc. We sequentialize these features as follows. We\nfirst select the longest time series, typically by merging the\nfeatures that represent items user engaged with, as the main\ntime series. The remaining features are generally time series\nthat slowly change over time, such as demographics or fol-\nlowed creators. We compress these time series by keeping\nthe earliest entry per consecutive segment and then merge\nthe results into the main time series. Given these time series\nchange very slowly, this approach does not significantly\nincrease the overall sequence length.\nNumerical (‘dense’) features. Examples of such features\ninclude weighted and decayed counters, ratios, etc. For in-\nstance, one feature could represent user’s past click through\nrate (CTR) on items matching a given topic. Compared\nto categorical features, these features change much more\nfrequently, potentially with every single (user, item) inter-\naction. It is therefore infeasible to fully sequentialize such\nfeatures from computational and storage perspectives. How-\never, an important observation is that the categorical features\n(e.g., item topics, locations) over which we perform these\naggregations are already sequentialized and encoded in GRs.\nHence, we can remove numerical features in GRs given a\nsufficiently expressive sequential transduction architecture\ncoupled with a target-aware formulation (Zhou et al., 2018)\ncan meaningfully capture numerical features as we increase\n2\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nSequentialized+model-based unified features Sequentialized+model-based unified features Sequentialized+model-based unified features\n   Numerical features   Numerical featuresCategorical features    Numerical featuresCategorical features\nGenerative Recommenders (GRs)\nmain time series\nDeep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs)\nG0\nt0\nΦ0\nt1,a0\nF0,F1\nE0,E1,...\nG0\nmerge & \nsequentialize\nG0\nt1\nG0\nt0 \nΦ1\nt2, a1\nH0\nt7\n... ...\nΦ0\nt1,a0\nΦ1\nt2, a1\nΦn-1\nt9, an-1\nauxiliary time series 1\nG0\nt2\nΦn-1\nt9, an-1\nCTR0\n(at t1)\nH0\nt7\nH0\nt8auxiliary time series 2\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nCausal-masked learned features \nvia (target-aware) cross attention\nsequentialize\nsequentialize\nG1\nt8\nG1\nt8\nH0\nt9\nRatio2\n(at t1)\nreplace w/ \nmodels\nΨ’0 (t2)Ψ’0 (t2) Ψ’1 (t9)Ψ’1 (t9)...\n...\nP(X=x)CTR0\n(at t2)\nCTR0\n(at t9)\n... ...\nRatio2\n(at t2)\nRatio2\n(at t9)\nE1,E2,...

Reformulating ranking and retrieval as sequential\ntransduction tasks\nGiven a list of n tokens x0, x1, . . . , xn−1 (xi ∈ X) ordered\nchronologically, the time when those tokens are observed\nt0, t1, . . . , tn−1, a sequential transduction task maps this\ninput sequence to the output tokens y0, y1, . . . , yn−1 (yi ∈\nX ∪ {∅}), where yi = ∅ indicates that yi is undefined.\nWe use Φi ∈ Xc (Xc ⊆ X) to denote a content (e.g., images\nor videos) that the system provides to the user. Given new\ncontent are constantly created, Xc and X are non-stationary.\nThe user can respond to Φi with some action ai (e.g., like,\nskip, video completion+share) ai ∈ X. We denote the total\nnumber of contents that a user has interacted with by nc.\nThe standard ranking and retrieval tasks, in causal autore-\ngressive settings, can then be defined as sequential transduc-\ntion tasks (Table 1). We make the following observations:\nTask Specification (Inputs / Outputs)\nRanking xis Φ0, a0, Φ1, a1, . . . ,Φnc−1, anc−1\nyis a0, ∅, a1, ∅, . . . , anc−1, ∅\nRetrieval\nxis (Φ0, a0), (Φ1, a1), . . . ,(Φnc−1, anc−1)\nyis Φ′\n1, Φ′\n2, . . . ,Φ′\nnc−1, ∅\n(Φ′\ni = Φi if ai is positive, otherwise ∅)\nTable 1. Ranking and retrieval as sequential transduction tasks.\nOther categorical features are omitted for simplicity. We compare\nGRs with traditional sequential recommenders in Appendix B.2.\nRetrieval. In recommendation system’s retrieval stage, we\nlearn a distribution p(Φi+1|ui) over Φi+1 ∈ Xc, where ui\nis the user’s representation at tokeni. A typical objective is\nto select arg maxΦ∈Xc p(Φ|ui) to maximize some reward.\nThis differs from a standard autoregressive setup in two\nways. First, the supervision for xi, yi, is not necessarily\nΦi+1, as users could respond negatively to Φi+1. Second,\nyi is undefined when xi+1 represents a non-engagement\nrelated categorical feature, such as demographics.\nRanking. Ranking tasks in GRs pose unique challenges as\nindustrial recommendation systems often require a “target-\naware” formulation. In such settings, “interaction” of target,\nΦi+1, and historical features needs to occur as early as\npossible, which is infeasible with a standard autoregressive\nsetup where “interaction” happens late (e.g., via softmax\nafter encoder output). We address this by interleaving items\nand actions in Table 1, which enables the ranking task to\nbe formulated as p(ai+1|Φ0, a0, Φ1, a1, . . . ,Φi+1) (before\ncategorical features). We apply a small neural network to\ntransform outputs at Φi+1 into multi-task predictions in\npractice. Importantly, this enables us to apply target-aware\ncross-attention to all nc engagements in one pass.\n2.3. Generative training\nIndustrial recommenders are commonly trained in a stream-\ning setup, where each example is processed sequentially as\nthey become available. In this setup, the total computational\nrequirement for self-attention based sequential transduction\narchitectures, such as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017),\nscales as P\ni ni(n2\ni d + nidf fd), where ni is the number of\ntokens of user i, and d is the embedding dimension. The\nfirst part in the parentheses comes from self-attention, with\nassumed O(n2) scaling factor due to most subquadratic al-\ngorithms involving quality tradeoffs and underperforming\nquadratic algorithms in wall-clock time (Dao et al., 2022).\nThe second part comes from pointwise MLP layers, with hid-\nden layers of size O(df f) = O(d). Taking N = maxi ni,\nthe overall time complexity reduces to O(N3d + N2d2),\nwhich is cost prohibitive for recommendation settings.\nTo tackle the challenge of training sequential transduc-\n3\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\ntion models over long sequences in a scalable manner, we\nmove from traditional impression-level training to genera-\ntive training, reducing the computational complexity by an\nO(N) factor, as shown at the top of Figure 2. By doing so,\nencoder costs are amortized across multiple targets. More\nspecifically, when we sample thei-th user at rate su(ni), the\ntotal training cost now scales as P\ni su(ni)ni(n2\ni d + nid2),\nwhich is reduced to O(N2d + N d2) by setting su(ni) to\n1/ni. One way to implement this sampling in industrial-\nscale systems is to emit training examples at the end of a\nuser’s request or session, resulting in ˆsu(ni) ∝ 1/ni.\n3. A High Performance Self-Attention Encoder\nfor Generative Recommendations\nTo scale up GRs for industrial-scale recommendation sys-\ntems with large, non-stationary vocabularies, we next intro-\nduce a new encoder design, Hierarchical Sequential Trans-\nduction Unit (HSTU). HSTU consists of a stack of identical\nlayers connected by residual connections (He et al., 2015).\nEach layer contains three sub-layers: Pointwise Projection\n(Equation 1), Spatial Aggregation (Equation 2), and Point-\nwise Transformation (Equation 3):\nU(X), V (X), Q(X), K(X) = Split(ϕ1(f1(X))) (1)\nA(X)V (X) = ϕ2\n\u0010\nQ(X)K(X)T + rabp,t\n\u0011\nV (X) (2)\nY (X) = f2 (Norm (A(X)V (X)) ⊙ U(X)) (3)\nwhere fi(X) denotes an MLP; we use one linear layer,\nfi(X) = Wi(X) + bi for f1 and f2 to reduce compute\ncomplexity and further batches computations for queries\nQ(X), keys K(X), values V (X), and gating weightsU(X)\nwith a fused kernel; ϕ1 and ϕ2 denote nonlinearity, for\nboth of which we use SiLU (Elfwing et al., 2017); Norm is\nlayer norm; and rabp,t denotes relative attention bias (Raffel\net al., 2020) that incorporates positional ( p) and temporal\n(t) information. Full notations used can be found in Table 9.\nHSTU encoder design allows for the replacement of hetero-\ngeneous modules in DLRMs with a single modular block.\nWe observe that there are, effectively, three main stages\nin DLRMs: Feature Extraction, Feature Interactions, and\nTransformations of Representations. Feature Extractions re-\ntrieves the pooled embedding representations of categorical\nfeatures. Their most advanced versions can be generalized\nas pairwise attention and target-aware pooling (Zhou et al.,\n2018), which is captured with HSTU layers.\nFeature Interaction is the most critical part of DLRMs.\nCommon approaches used include factorization machines\nand their neural network variants (Rendle, 2010; Guo\net al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017), higher order feature interac-\ntions (Wang et al., 2021), etc. HSTU replaces feature interac-\ntions by enabling attention pooled features to directly “inter-\nact” with other features via Norm (A(X)V (X)) ⊙ U(X).\nFeature Interactions \nNeural Networks\n(FMs, DCN, \nTransformers, DHEN, \n…)\nEmbedding \nOperators / \nEmbeddings\nCategorical \nFeatures in \nDLRMs\nNumerical \nFeatures in \nDLRMs\nBottom \nNeural \nNetworks\nTop Neural \nNetworks \n(MMoE, PLE, …)\nSequentialized Unified Features\nRepresentation transformationsFeature extractions Feature interactions\nRaw Features\nAdd&Norm\nAdd&Norm\nPreprocessing\nA(X)=ϕ2(QKT+rabP,T)\nU, Q, K, V = ϕ1(f1(X))\nNorm(A(X)V(X))⊙U(X)\nU(X)\nY(X) = f2(...)\nA(X)=ϕ2(QKT+rabP,T)\nU, Q, K, V = ϕ1(f1(X))\nNorm(A(X)V(X))⊙U(X)\nU(X)\nY(X) = f2(...)\nA(X)=ϕ2(QKT+rabP,T)\nU, Q, K, V = ϕ1(f1(X))\nNorm(A(X)V(X))⊙U(X)\nU(X)\nY(X) = f2(...)\nA(X)=ϕ2(QKT+rabP,T)\nU, Q, K, V = ϕ1(f1(X))\nNorm(A(X)V(X))⊙U(X)\nU(X)\nY(X) = f2(...)\nA(X)=ϕ2(QKT+rabP,T)\nU, Q, K, V = ϕ1(f1(X))\nNorm(A(X)V(X))⊙U(X)\nU(X)\nY(X) = f2(...)\nA(X)=ϕ2(QKT+rabP,T)\nU, Q, K, V = ϕ1(f1(X))\nNorm(A(X)V(X))⊙U(X)\nU(X)\nY(X) = f2(...)\nFigure 3. Comparison of key model components: DLRMs vs GRs.\nThe complete DLRM setup (Mudigere et al., 2022) is shown on\nthe left side and a simplified HSTU is shown on the right.\nThis design is motivated by the difficulty of approximat-\ning dot products with learned MLPs (Rendle et al., 2020;\nZhai et al., 2023a). Given SiLU is applied to U(X),\nNorm (A(X)V (X)) ⊙ U(X) can also be interpreted as a\nvariant of SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020).\nTransformations of Representations is commonly done with\nMixture of Experts (MoEs) and routing to handle diverse,\nheterogeneous populations. A key idea is to perform condi-\ntional computations by specializing sub-networks for differ-\nent users (Ma et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2020). Element-wise\ndot products in HSTU can virtually perform gating opera-\ntions used in MoEs up to a normalization factor.\n3.1. Pointwise aggregated attention\nHSTU adopts a new pointwise aggregated (normalized) at-\ntention mechanism (in contrast, softmax attention computes\nnormalization factor over the entire sequence). This is moti-\nvated by two factors. First, the number of prior data points\nrelated to target serves as a strong feature indicating the\nintensity of user preferences, which is hard to capture after\nsoftmax normalization. This is critical as we need to predict\nboth the intensity of engagements, e.g., time spent on a given\nitem, and the relative ordering of the items, e.g., predicting\nan ordering to maximize AUC. Second, while softmax acti-\nvation is robust to noise by construction, it is less suited for\nnon-stationary vocabularies in streaming settings.\nThe proposed pointwise aggregated attention mechanism is\ndepicted in Equation (2). Importantly, layer norm is needed\nafter pointwise pooling to stabilize training. One way to\n4\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nArchitecture HR@10 HR@50\nTransformers .0442 .2025\nHSTU (-rabp,t, Softmax) .0617 .2496\nHSTU (-rabp,t) .0893 .3170\nTable 2. Synthetic data in one-pass streaming settings.\nunderstand this design is through synthetic data following\na Dirichlet Process that generates streaming data over a\nnonstationary vocabulary (details in Appendix C). In this\nsetting, we can observe gaps as large as 44.7% between\nsoftmax and pointwise attention setups as shown in Table 2.\n3.2. Leveraging and algorithmically increasing sparsity\nIn recommendation systems, the length of user history se-\nquences often follows a skewed distribution, leading to\nsparse input sequences, particularly in the settings with\nvery long sequences. This sparsity can be leveraged to sig-\nnificantly improve the efficiency of the encoder. To achieve\nthis, we have developed an efficient attention kernel for\nGPUs that fuses back-to-back GEMMs in a manner sim-\nilar to (Rabe & Staats, 2021; Dao et al., 2022) but per-\nforms fully raggified attention computations. This essen-\ntially transforms the attention computation into grouped\nGEMMs of various sizes (Appendix G). As a result, self-\nattention in HSTU becomes memory-bound and scales as\nΘ(P\ni n2\ni d2\nqkR−1) in terms of memory accesses, where ni\nis the sequence length for sample i, dqk is attention dimen-\nsion, and R is the register size. This approach by itself leads\nto 2-5x throughput gains as discussed in Section 4.2.\nWe further algorithmically increase the sparsity of user his-\ntory sequences via Stochastic Length (SL). One key char-\nacteristic of user history sequences in recommendations is\nthat user behaviors are temporally repetitive, as user behav-\niors manifest at multiple scales throughout their interaction\nhistory. This represents an opportunity to increase sparsity\nartificially without compromising model quality, thereby\nsignificantly reducing encoder cost that scales as Θ(P\ni n2\ni ).\nWe can represent user j’s history as a sequence (xi)nc,j\ni=0 ,\nwhere nc,j is the number of contents user interacted with.\nLet Nc = max j nc,j. Let (xik)L\nk=0 be a subsequence of\nlength L constructed from the original sequence (xi)nc,j\ni=0 .\nSL selects input sequences as follows:\n(xi)\nnc,j\ni=0 if nc,j ≤ N α/2\nc\n(xik)N α/2\nc\nk=0 if nc,j > N α/2\nc , w/ probability 1 − N α\nc /n2\nc,j\n(xi)\nnc,j\ni=0 if nc,j > N α/2\nc , w/ probability N α\nc /n2\nc,j\n(4)\nwhich reduces attention-related complexity to O(N α\nc d) =\nO(N αd) for α ∈ (1, 2]. A more thorough discussion of\nsubsequence selection can be found in Appendix F.1. We\nremark that applying SL to training leads to a cost-effective\nsystem design, as training generally involves a significantly\nhigher computational cost compared to inference.\nAlpha (α) Max Sequence Lengths\n1,024 2,048 4,096 8,192\n1.6 71.5% 76.1% 80.5% 84.4%\n1.7 56.1% 63.6% 69.8% 75.6%\n1.8 40.2% 45.3% 54.1% 66.4%\n1.9 17.2% 21.0% 36.3% 64.1%\n2.0 3.1% 6.6% 29.1% 64.1%\nTable 3.

The rows labeled “α = 2.0”\nrepresents the base sparsity case where SL is not applied.\nLower α’s are applicable to longer sequences up to the\nlongest sequence length we tested, 8,192.\n3.3. Minimizing activation memory usage\nIn recommendation systems, the use of large batch sizes is\ncrucial for both training throughput (Mudigere et al., 2022)\nand model quality (Yang et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020;\nZhai et al., 2023a). Consequently, activation memory usage\nbecomes a major scaling bottleneck, in contrast to large\nlanguage models that are commonly trained with small batch\nsizes and dominated by parameter memory usage.\nCompared to Transformers, HSTU employs a simplified\nand fully fused design that significantly reduces activation\nmemory usage. Firstly, HSTU reduces the number of linear\nlayers outside of attention from six to two, aligning with\nrecent work that uses elementwise gating to reduce MLP\ncomputations (Hua et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2022). Secondly,\nHSTU aggressively fuses computations into single opera-\ntors, including ϕ1(f1(·)) in Equation (1), and layer norm,\noptional dropout, and output MLP in Equation (3). This\nsimplified design reduces the activation memory usage to\n2d+2d+4hdqk +4hdv +2hdv = 14d per layer in bfloat16.\nFor comparison, Transformers use a feedforward layer and\ndropout after attention (intermediate state of 3hdv), fol-\nlowed by a pointwise feedforward block consisting of layer\nnorm, linear, activation, linear, and dropout, with intermedi-\nate states of 2d + 4df f + 2d + 1d = 4 d + 4df f. Here,\nwe make standard assumptions that hdv ≥ d and that\ndf f = 4d (Vaswani et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2020). Thus,\nafter accounting for input and input layer norm ( 4d) and\nqkv projections, the total activation states is 33d. HSTU’s\ndesign hence enables scaling to > 2x deeper layers.\nAdditionally, large scale atomic ids used to represent vocab-\nularies also require significant memory usage. With a 10b\nvocabulary, 512d embeddings, and Adam optimizer, storing\nembeddings and optimizer states in fp32 already requires\n60TB memory. To alleviate memory pressure, we employ\nrowwise AdamW optimizers (Gupta et al., 2014; Khudia\n5\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\net al., 2021) and place optimizer states on DRAM, which\nreduces HBM usage per float from 12 bytes to 2 bytes.\n3.4. Scaling up inference via cost-amortization\nThe last challenge we address is the large number of candi-\ndates recommendation systems need to process at serving\ntime. We focus on ranking as for retrieval, encoder cost\nis fully amortizable, and efficient algorithms exist for both\nMIPS leveraging quantization, hashing, or partitioning (Je-\ngou et al., 2011; Shrivastava & Li, 2014; Li et al., 2002;\nZhai et al., 2011) and non-MIPS cases via beam search or\nhierarchical retrieval (Zhuo et al., 2020; Zhai et al., 2023a).\nFor ranking, we have up to tens of thousands of candi-\ndates (Covington et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020). We pro-\npose an algorithm M-FALCON (Microbatched-Fast Atten-\ntion Leveraging Cacheable OperatioNs) to perform infer-\nence for m candidates with an input sequence size of n.\nWithin a forward pass, M-FALCON handles bm candidates\nin parallel by modifying attention masks and rabp,t biases\nsuch that the attention operations performed for bm candi-\ndates are exactly the same. This reduces the cost of apply-\ning cross-attention from O(bmn2d) to O((n + bm)2d) =\nO(n2d) when bm can be considered a small constant rela-\ntive to n. We optionally divide the overallm candidates into\n⌈m/bm⌉ microbatches of size bm to leverage encoder-level\nKV caching (Pope et al., 2022) either across forward passes\nto reduce cost, or across requests to minimize tail latency\n(More detailed discussions in Appendix H).\nOverall, M-FALCON enables model complexity to linearly\nscale up with the number of candidates in traditional DL-\nRMs’s ranking stages; we succeeded in applying a 285x\nmore complex target-aware cross attention model at 1.5x-3x\nthroughput with a constant inference budget for a typical\nranking configuration discussed in Section 4.3.",

(2018)에서 관찰한 바와 같습니다. 1만 개 이상의 이러한 특징을 활용하기 위해 DLRM은 중간 표현을 결합하고 최종 출력을 구성하기 위해 다양한 신경망을 사용합니다.\n\n인간이 설계한 방대한 특징 집합과 막대한 양의 데이터를 사용하여 훈련되었음에도 불구하고 대부분의 산업 규모 DLRM은 컴퓨팅 자원으로 인해 제대로 확장되지 못합니다 (Zhao et al., 2023). 이러한 제한 사항은 주목할 만하며 해결되지 않은 문제입니다.\n\n트랜스포머의 언어 및 비전 분야에서의 성공에 영감을 받아, 우리는 현대 추천 시스템의 기본 설계 선택을 재고합니다. 대체 형식을 억만 명 규모에서 극복하기 위해 세 가지 과제를 해결해야 합니다. 첫째, 추천 시스템의 특징은 명시적인 구조가 부족합니다. 순차적 형식이 소규모 설정에서 탐구되었지만 (부록 B에서 자세한 논의), 고차원 특징, 교차 특징, 카운터, 비율 등은 산업 규모 DLRM에서 중요한 역할을 합니다 (Mudigere et al., 2022). 둘째, 추천 시스템은 100K 규모의 정적 어휘와 달리 지속적으로 변화하는 억만 규모 어휘를 사용합니다 (Brown et al., 2020). 이러한 억만 규모 동적 어휘는 1~2개월 동안 언어에서 처리하는 것보다 훨씬 더 많은 토큰을 처리해야 하므로 훈련 과제를 야기하고 대상에 맞는 방식으로 1만 개 이상의 후보를 고려해야 하므로 추론 비용이 높습니다 (Zhou et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020). 마지막으로, 대규모 순차적 모델을 가능하게 하는 컴퓨팅 비용이 주요 병목 현상을 나타냅니다. GPT-3는 수천 개의 GPU를 사용하여 총 300B 토큰을 1~2개월 동안 훈련했습니다 (Brown et al., 2020). 이러한 규모는 압도적으로 보이지만, 인터넷 플랫폼이 매일 수십억 명의 활성 사용자에게 콘텐츠, 이미지 및 비디오를 제공한다는 점을 고려해 볼 때, 사용자 행동의 규모를 비교해 볼 수 있습니다. 사용자 시퀀스는 최대 10^5까지 이어질 수 있습니다 (Chang et al., 2023). 결과적으로 추천 시스템은 언어가 1~2개월 동안 처리하는 것보다 하루에 몇 배 더 많은 토큰을 처리해야 합니다.\n\n이 연구에서 우리는 생성 모델링의 새로운 모다리인 사용자 행동을 다룹니다. 우리의 주요 통찰력은 다음과 같습니다. a) 적절한 새로운 특징 공간을 통해 산업 규모 추천 시스템의 핵심 랭킹 및 검색 작업은 생성 모델링 문제로 구성될 수 있으며, b) 이러한 패러다임은 특징, 훈련 및 추론의 중복을 체계적으로 활용하여 효율성을 개선할 수 있습니다. 새로운 우리의 형식을 통해 모델이 이전 최첨단 모델보다 3배 더 복잡한 컴퓨팅 복잡성을 가지면서도 12.4%의 탑라인 지표 개선을 달성했습니다 (Figure 1 참조). 우리의 기여는 다음과 같습니다. 첫째, 우리는 Section 2에서 Generative Recommenders (GRs)라는 새로운 패러다임을 제안합니다. GRs는 DLRM을 대체하는 순차화 및 다양한 특징 공간을 통합합니다. 새로운 접근 방식은 무한대로 기하급수적으로 증가하는 DLRM 특징 공간을 시퀀스 길이로 근사하여 주요 추천 문제를 순차적 생성 트랜스두서 작업으로 재구성합니다. 이는 GRs에서 순차적 생성 방식으로 훈련을 수행할 수 있도록 하여 동일한 컴퓨팅 자원으로 훨씬 더 많은 데이터를 훈련할 수 있도록 합니다.\n\n둘째, 우리는 훈련 및 추론 전반에 걸쳐 컴퓨팅 비용 문제를 해결합니다. 우리는 계층적\n\n[... 길이 제한으로 생략 ...]"

T RADITIONAL SEQUENTIAL SETTINGS\nWe first evaluate the performance of HSTU on two popular\nrecommender datasets, MovieLens and Amazon Reviews.\nWe follow sequential recommendation settings in literature,\nincluding full shuffle and multi-epoch training. For baseline,\nwe use SASRec, a state-of-the-art Transformer implementa-\ntion (Kang & McAuley, 2018)1. We report Hit Rate@K and\nNDCG@K over the entire corpus, consistent with recent\nwork (Dallmann et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2023a).\nResults are presented in Table 4. “SASRec (2023)” denotes\nthe best SASRec recipe reported in (Zhai et al., 2023a). The\n1Results for other baselines are reported in Appendix D.\nrows labeled “HSTU” use identical configurations as SAS-\nRec (same number of layers, heads, etc.). “HSTU-large”\nrepresents larger HSTU encoders (4x number of layers and\n2x number of heads). Results show that a) HSTU, with its\ndesign optimized for recommendations, significantly outper-\nforms the baseline when using the same configuration, and\nb) HSTU further improves performance when scaled up.\nIt is important to note that the evaluation methodology used\nhere differs significantly from industrial-scale settings, as\nfull-shuffle and multi-epoch training are generally not practi-\ncal in streaming settings used in industry (Liu et al., 2022).\n4.1.2. I NDUSTRIAL -SCALE STREAMING SETTINGS\nWe next compare the performance of HSTU, ablated HS-\nTUs, and transformers using industrial-scale datasets in a\nstreaming setting. Throughout the rest of this section, we re-\nport Normalized Entropy (NE) (He et al., 2014) for ranking.\nWe train the models over 100B examples (DLRM equiva-\nlent), with 64-256 H100s used per job. Given ranking is\ndone in a multi-task setting, we report the main engage-\nment event (“E-Task”) and the main consumption event\n(“C-Task”). In our context, we consider a 0.001 reduction\nin NE significant as it generally leads to .5% topline met-\nric improvements for billions of users. For retrieval, given\nthe setup is similar to language modeling, we report log\nperplexity. We fix encoder parameters in a smaller-scale\nsetting (l = 3, n = 2048, d = 512 for ranking and l = 6,\nn = 512 , d = 256 for retrieval), and grid-search other\nhyperparameters due to resource limits.\nWe show results in Table 5. First, HSTU significantly out-\nperforms Transformers, especially in ranking, likely due\nto pointwise attention and improved relative attention bi-\nases. Second, the gaps between the ablated HSTUs and\nHSTU confirm the effectiveness of our designs. Optimal\nlearning rates are about 10x lower for Softmax-based HSTU\nand Transformer vs the rest due to training stability. Even\nwith lower learning rates and pre-norm residual connec-\ntions (Xiong et al., 2020), we encountered frequent loss\nexplosions with standard Transformers in ranking. Finally,\nHSTU outperforms a popular Transformer variant used in\nLLMs, Transformer++ (Touvron et al., 2023a), which uses\nRoPE (Su et al., 2023), SwiGLU, etc. Overall, in this small-\nscale setting, HSTU shows better quality at 1.5x-2x faster\nwall-clock time and 50% less HBM usage.\n4.2.

Figure 5 compares the efficiency\nof HSTU and Transformer encoders in training and infer-\nence settings. For Transformers, we use the state-of-the-art\nFlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) implementation. We consider\nsequence lengths ranging from 1,024 to 8,192 and apply\nStochastic Length (SL) during training. In the evaluation,\nwe use the same configuration for HSTU and Transformer\n(d = 512, h = 8, dqk = 64) and ablate relative attention\nbias considering HSTU outperforms Transformers without\nrabp,t, as demonstrated in Section 4.1.2. We compare the\nencoder-level performance in bfloat16 on NVIDIA H100\nGPUs. Overall, HSTU is up to 15.2x and 5.6x more efficient\nthan Transformers in training and inference, respectively.\nAdditionally, the decrease in activation memory usage as\ndiscussed in Section 3.3 enables us to construct over 2x\ndeeper networks with HSTUs compared to Transformers.\nTable 6.

Generative Recommenders vs DLRMs in\nIndustrial-scale Streaming Settings\nLastly, we compare the end-to-end performance of GRs\nagainst state-of-the-art DLRM baselines in industrial-scale\nstreaming settings. Our GR implementation reflects a typ-\nical configuration used in production, whereas the DLRM\nsettings reflect iterations of hundreds of people over multi-\nple years. Given multiple generators are used in the retrieval\nstage of a recommendation system, we report both the online\nresult for adding GR (“add source”) and replacing existing\nmain DLRM source (“replace source”). Table 6 and Table 7\nshow that GR not only significantly outperforms DLRMs\noffline, but also brings 12.4% wins in A/B tests.\nAs discussed in Section 2, GRs build upon raw categorical\nengagement features, while DLRMs are typically trained\nwith a significantly larger number of features, the majority\nof which are handcrafted from raw signals. If we give the\nsame set of features used in GRs to DLRMs (“DLRM (abl.\nfeatures)”), the performance of DLRMs is significantly de-\ngraded, which suggests GRs can meaningfully capture those\nfeatures via their architecture and unified feature space.\nWe further validate the GR formulation in Section 2.2 by\ncomparing it with a traditional sequential recommender\nsetup that only considers items user interacted with (Kang\n7\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\n(a) Training NE.\n(b) Training Speedup.\nSequence Length\nLatency (ms)\n0.00\n25.00\n50.00\n75.00\n100.00\n125.00\n1024 2048 4096 8192\nHSTU Transformers\n(c) Inference Speedup.\nFigure 5.

The results\nare significantly worse, with its ranking variant underper-\nforming GRs by 2.6% in NE in the main consumption task.\nConsidering the popularity of content-based methods (in-\ncluding LMs), we also include a GR baseline with only con-\ntent features (“GR (content-based)”). The substantial gap in\nperformance of content-based baselines and DLRMs/GRs\nunderscores the significance of high cardinality user actions.\nWe finally compare the efficiency of GRs with our produc-\ntion DLRMs in Figure 6. Despite the GR model being 285x\nmore computationally complex, we achieved 1.50x/2.99x\nhigher QPS when scoring 1024/16384 candidates, due to\nHSTU and the novel M-FALCON algorithm in Section 3.4.\n4.3.1.

Comparison of inference throughput, in the most chal-\nlenging ranking setup. Full results can be found in Appendix H.1.\nregimes (Zhao et al., 2023). We compare the scalability of\nGRs and DLRMs to better understand this phenomenon.\nSince feature interaction layers are crucial for DLRM’s per-\nformance (Mudigere et al., 2022), we experimented with\nTransformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), DHEN (Zhang et al.,\n2022), and a variant of DCN (Wang et al., 2021) augmented\nwith residual connections (He et al., 2015) used in our pro-\nduction settings to scale up the DLRM baseline in the rank-\ning setting. For the retrieval baseline, given our baseline\nused a residual setup, we scaled up hidden layer sizes, em-\nbedding dimensions, and number of layers. For HSTU-\nbased Generative Recommenders (GRs), we scaled up the\nmodel by adjusting the hyperparameters for HSTU, includ-\ning the number of residual layers, sequence length, em-\nbedding dimensions, number of attention heads, etc. We\nadditionally adjust the number of negatives for retrieval.\nResults are shown in Figure 7. In the low compute regime,\nDLRMs might outperform GRs due to handcrafted features,\ncorroborating the importance of feature engineering in tra-\nditional DLRMs. However, GRs demonstrate substantially\nbetter scalability with respect to FLOPs, whereas DLRM\nperformance plateaus, consistent with findings in prior work.\nWe also observe better scalability w.r.t. both embedding pa-\nrameters and non-embedding parameters, with GRs leading\nto 1.5 trillion parameter models, whereas DLRMs perfor-\nmance saturate at about 200 billion parameters.\nFinally, all of our main metrics, including Hit Rate@100 and\nHit Rate@500 for retrieval, and NE for ranking, empirically\nscale as a power law of compute used given appropriate\nhyperparameters. We observe this phenomenon across three\norders of magnitude, up till the largest models we were able\nto test (8,192 sequence length, 1,024 embedding dimension,\n24 layers of HSTU), at which point the total amount of com-\npute we used (normalized over 365 days as we use a stan-\ndard streaming training setting) is close to the total training\ncompute used by GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and LLaMa-\n2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), as shown in Figure 1. Within\na reasonable range, the exact model hyperparameters play\nless important roles compared to the total amount of training\ncompute applied. In contrast to language modeling (Kaplan\net al., 2020), sequence length play a significantly more im-\nportant role in GRs, and it’s important to scale up sequence\n8\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nTraining PetaFLOPs per day\nEval Hit Rate@100\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n1000 5000 10000 50000 100000\nTraditional DLRMs Generative Recommenders (GRs)\nL = .15 + .0195 ln C\nTraining PetaFLOPs per day\nEval Hit Rate@500\n0.50\n0.55\n0.60\n0.65\n1000 5000 10000 50000 100000\nTraditional DLRMs Generative Recommenders (GRs)\nL = .395 + .0212 ln C\nTraining PetaFLOPs per day\nEval NE (lower is better)\n0.47\n0.48\n0.49\n0.50\n0.51\n1000 10000 100000 1000000\nTraditional DLRMs Generative Recommenders (GRs)\nL = .549 + -5.3E-03 ln C\nFigure 7.

HSTU 인과적 가설 검증**\n\n4.1.1. 전통적인 순차적 설정\n우선 HSTU의 성능을 MovieLens 및 Amazon Reviews 두 가지 인기 있는 추천 데이터 세트에서 평가합니다. 문헌에 따른 전통적인 순차적 설정(전체 셔플 및 다중 에포크 훈련 포함)을 따릅니다. 기준선으로, 최첨단 트랜스포머 구현인 SASRec(Kang & McAuley, 2018)1을 사용합니다. Hit Rate@K 및 NDCG@K를 전체 코퍼스에 대해 보고하며, 최근 작업(Dallmann et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2023a)와 일관성을 유지합니다. 결과는 표 4에 제시되어 있습니다. “SASRec (2023)”는 (Zhai et al., 2023a)에서 보고된 최적의 SASRec 레시피를 나타냅니다.\n1 다른 기준선의 결과는 부록 D에 보고되어 있습니다. “HSTU” 레이블이 붙은 행은 SAS-Rec(동일한 레이어 수, 헤드 수 등)와 동일한 구성으로 사용됩니다. “HSTU-large”는 4배 레이어 수 및 2배 헤드 수의 더 큰 HSTU 인코더를 나타냅니다. 결과는 a) HSTU는 추천에 최적화된 설계를 통해 기준선보다 훨씬 뛰어난 성능을 보이며, b) HSTU는 확장될 때 성능을 더욱 향상시킵니다.\n\n중요한 점은 이 평가 방법론이 산업 규모 설정과 크게 다르다는 것입니다. 왜냐하면 전체 셔플 및 다중 에포크 훈련은 일반적으로 스트리밍 환경에서 실용적이지 않기 때문입니다(Liu et al., 2022).\n\n4.1.2. 산업 규모 스트리밍 설정\n다음으로 HSTU, ablated HSTU, 그리고 트랜스포머가 산업 규모 데이터 세트에서 스트리밍 설정에서 성능을 비교합니다. 이 섹션의 나머지 부분에서 순위 결정에 대해 Normalized Entropy (NE) (He et al., 2014)를 보고합니다. 모델은 100B개의 예제(DLRM에 해당하는)를 사용하여 훈련되었으며, 각 작업에 대해 64-256개의 H100이 사용되었습니다. 순위 결정이 다중 작업 설정에서 수행되기 때문에, 우리는 주요 참여 이벤트 (“E-Task”) 및 주요 소비 이벤트 (“C-Task”)를 보고합니다. 우리의 맥락에서 0.001 감소된 NE를 중요하게 간주하며, 이는 일반적으로 수십억 명의 사용자에게 0.5%의 탑라인 지표 개선을 가져옵니다. 검색의 경우, 설정이 언어 모델링과 유사하기 때문에 log perplexity를 보고합니다. 인코더 매개변수를 더 작은 규모 설정(l = 3, n = 2048, d = 512 순위 결정 및 l = 6, n = 512, d = 256 검색을 위해)에서 고정하고, 리소스 제한으로 인해 그리드 검색을 수행했습니다.\n\n표 5에 결과를 제시합니다. 첫째, HSTU는 트랜스포머보다 훨씬 뛰어난 성능을 보이며, 특히 순위 결정에서 그렇습니다. 이는 pointwise attention 및 개선된 relative attention biases 때문일 가능성이 높습니다. 둘째, ablated HSTU와 HSTU 간의 간격은 우리의 디자인의 효과를 확인합니다. 최적의 학습률은 Softmax 기반 HSTU 및 트랜스포머에 대해 10배 낮으며, 이는 훈련 안정성 때문입니다. 심지어 낮은 학습률과 pre-norm residual connections (Xiong et al., 2020)을 사용하더라도 표준 트랜스포머는 순위 결정에서 빈번한 손실 폭발을 겪었습니다. 마지막으로, HSTU는 LLM에서 사용되는 인기 있는 트랜스포머 변형인 Transformer++ (Touvron et al., 2023a)보다 우수한 성능을 보입니다. 이 변형은 RoPE (Su et al., 2023), SwiGLU 등을 사용합니다. 전반적으로 이 작은 규모 설정에서 HSTU는 1.5x-2x 더 빠른 wall-clock 시간과 50% 적은 HBM 사용량으로 더 나은 품질을 보여줍니다.\n\n4.2. 인코더 효율성\n스토카스티크 길이. 그림 4 및 그림 5 (a)는 모델 지표에 스토카스티크 길이 (SL)의 영향을 보여줍니다. α = 1.6일 때, 길이가 4096 토큰의 시퀀스는 대부분의 경우 776 토큰의 시퀀스로 변환되며, 80% 이상 토큰을 제거합니다. 스파라시티 비율이 64%-84%까지 증가하더라도 주요 작업에 대한 NE가 6\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nTable 4.

          "original": "Prior work on sequential recommenders reduces user interac-\ntions to a single homogeneous sequence over items (Hidasi\net al., 2016; Kang & McAuley, 2018). Industrial-scale ap-\nplications of sequential approaches are primarily pairwise\nattention (Zhou et al., 2018) or sequential encoders as part\nof DLRMs (Chen et al., 2019; Xia et al., 2023). Multi-stage\nattention has been explored in lieu of self-attention to im-\nprove efficiency (Chang et al., 2023). Generative approaches\nthat represent ids as a token series have been explored in\nretrieval (Zhuo et al., 2020). We give a more extensive\ndiscussion of prior work in Appendix B.1.\nEfficient attention has been a major research focus area due\nto self-attention’s O(n2) scaling factor, with major work\nlike factorized attentions (Child et al., 2019), low-rank ap-\nproximations (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), etc. Recently,\nalternative formulations for sequential transduction settings\nhave been explored (Gu et al., 2022; Hua et al., 2022).\nHSTU’s elementwise gating design, in particular, is inspired\nby FLASH (Hua et al., 2022). Recent hardware-aware for-\nmulations have been shown to significantly reduce memory\nusage (Rabe & Staats, 2021; Korthikanti et al., 2022; Zhai\net al., 2023b) and give significantly better wallclock time\nresults (Dao et al., 2022). Length extrapolation enables\nmodels trained on shorter sequences to generalize, though\nmost work focuses on finetuning or improving bias mech-\nanisms (Press et al., 2022). Our work instead introduces\nstochasticity in the length dimension, inspired by work on\nstochasticity in the depth dimension (Huang et al., 2016).\nInterests in large language models (LLMs) have motivated\nwork to treat various recommendation tasks as in-context\nlearning (Sileo et al., 2022), instruction tuning (Bao et al.,\n2023), or transfer learning (Li et al., 2023) on top of pre-\ntrained LLMs. World knowledge embedded in LLMs can\nbe transferred to downstream tasks (Cui et al., 2022) and\nimprove recommendations in zero-shot or few-shot cases.\nTextual representations of user behavior sequences have\nalso demonstrated good scaling behaviors on medium-scale\ndatasets (Shin et al., 2023). Most studies of LLMs for rec-\nommendation have been centered around low-data regimes;\nin large-scale settings, they have yet to outperform collabo-\nrative filtering on MovieLens (Hou et al., 2024).",

ID를 토큰 시퀀스로 표현하는 생성적 접근 방식이 검색에서 탐구되었습니다 (Zhuo et al., 2020). 자세한 내용은 부록 B.1에서 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\n자체 주의의 O(n²) 스케일링 요인으로 인해 효율적인 주의는 주요 연구 분야로 부각되었으며, 인자화된 주의 (Child et al., 2019), 저차원 근사 (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) 등과 같은 주요 작업이 있었습니다. 최근에는 순차적 전이 설정에 대한 대안적인 형태가 탐구되었습니다 (Gu et al., 2022; Hua et al., 2022). 특히 HSTU의 요소별 게이팅 디자인은 FLASH (Hua et al., 2022)에서 영감을 받았습니다. 최근 하드웨어에 대한 인식 기반 형태는 메모리 사용량을 크게 줄이는 것으로 나타났습니다 (Rabe & Staats, 2021; Korthikanti et al., 2022; Zhai et al., 2023b) 및 벽시계 시간 결과에서 상당한 개선을 보였습니다 (Dao et al., 2022). 길이 확장법을 통해 더 짧은 시퀀스로 훈련된 모델이 일반화되도록 할 수 있지만, 대부분의 작업은 미세 조정 또는 편향 메커니즘 개선에 초점을 맞추고 있습니다 (Press et al., 2022). 대신, 저희 연구는 깊이 차원에서 무작위성을 도입하여 Huang et al., 2016의 깊이 차원에서의 무작위성 연구에서 영감을 받았습니다. 대규모 언어 모델(LLM)에 대한 관심은 다양한 추천 작업을 인-컨텍스트 학습 (Sileo et al., 2022), 지시 조정 (Bao et al., 2023) 또는 사전 훈련된 LLM 위에 전이 학습 (Li et al., 2023)으로 취급하도록 동기를 부여했습니다. LLM에 내재된 세계 지식은 하위 작업으로 전송되어 중간 규모 데이터 세트에서 제안 사항을 개선할 수 있습니다 (Shin et al., 2023). LLM에 대한 대부분의 연구는 저 데이터 환경에 초점을 맞추었습니다. 대규모 설정에서는 협업 필터링이 MovieLens에서 성능을 능가하지 못했습니다 (Hou et al., 2024)."

          "original": "We have proposed Generative Recommenders (GRs), a new\nparadigm that formulates ranking and retrieval as sequential\ntransduction tasks, allowing them to be trained in a gener-\native manner. This is made possible by the novel HSTU\nencoder design, which is 5.3x-15.2x faster than state-of-the-\nart Transformers on 8192 length sequences, and through\nthe use of new training and inference algorithms such as\nM-FALCON. With GRs, we deployed models that are 285x\nmore complex while using less inference compute. GRs and\nHSTU have led to 12.4% metric improvements in production\nand have shown superior scaling performance compared to\ntraditional DLRMs. Our results corroborate that user actions\nrepresent an underexplored modality in generative modeling\n– to echo our title, “Actions speak louder than words”.\nThe dramatic simplification of features in our work paves the\nway for the first foundation models for recommendations,\nsearch, and ads by enabling a unified feature space to be\nused across domains. The fully sequential setup of GRs also\nenables recommendation to be formulated in an end-to-end,\ngenerative setting. Both of these enable recommendation\nsystems to better assist users holistically.\n9\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nIMPACT STATEMENTS\nWe believe that our work has broad positive implications.\nReducing reliance of recommendation, search, and ads sys-\ntems on the large number of heterogeneous features can\nmake these systems much more privacy friendly while im-\nproving user experiences. Enabling recommendation sys-\ntems to attribute users’ long term outcomes to short-term\ndecisions via fully sequential formulations could reduce the\nprevalence of content that do not serve users’ long term\ngoals (including clickbaits and fake news) across the web,\nand better align incentives of platforms with user values. Fi-\nnally, applications of foundation models and scaling law can\nhelp reduce carbon footprints incurred with model research\nand developments needed for recommendations, search, and\nrelated use cases.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work represents the joint efforts of hundreds of people,\nand would not be possible without work from the following\ncontributors (alphabetical order): Adnan Akhundov, Bugra\nAkyildiz, Shabab Ayub, Alex Bao, Renqin Cai, Jennifer\nCao, Guoqiang Jerry Chen, Lei Chen, Sean Chen, Xianjie\nChen, Huihui Cheng, Weiwei Chu, Ted Cui, Shiyan Deng,\nNimit Desai, Fei Ding, Francois Fagan, Lu Fang, Liang\nGuo, Liz Guo, Jeevan Gyawali, Yuchen Hao, Daisy Shi He,\nSamuel Hsia, Jie Hua, Yanzun Huang, Hongyi Jia, Rui Jian,\nJian Jin, Rahul Kindi, Changkyu Kim, Yejin Lee, Fu Li,\nHong Li, Shen Li, Wei Li, Zhijing Li, Xueting Liao, Emma\nLin, Hao Lin, Jingzhou Liu, Xingyu Liu, Kai Londenberg,\nLiang Luo, Linjian Ma, Matt Ma, Yun Mao, Bert Maher,\nMatthew Murphy, Satish Nadathur, Min Ni, Jongsoo Park,\nJing Qian, Lijing Qin, Alex Singh, Timothy Shi, Dennis\nvan der Staay, Xiao Sun, Colin Taylor, Shin-Yeh Tsai, Ro-\nhan Varma, Omkar Vichare, Alyssa Wang, Pengchao Wang,\nShengzhi Wang, Wenting Wang, Xiaolong Wang, Zhiyong\nWang, Wei Wei, Bin Wen, Carole-Jean Wu, Eric Xu, Bi Xue,\nZheng Yan, Chao Yang, Junjie Yang, Zimeng Yang, Chunx-\ning Yin, Daniel Yin, Yiling You, Keke Zhai, Yanli Zhao,\nZhuoran Zhao, Hui Zhang, Jingjing Zhang, Lu Zhang, Lujia\nZhang, Na Zhang, Rui Zhang, Xiong Zhang, Ying Zhang,\nZhiyun Zhang, Charles Zheng, Erheng Zhong, Xin Zhuang.\nWe would like to thank Shikha Kapoor, Rex Cheung, Lana\nDam, Ram Ramanathan, Nipun Mathur, Bo Feng, Yanhong\nWu, Zhaohui Guo, Hongjie Bai, Wen-Yun Yang, Zellux\nWang, Arun Singh, Bruce Deng, Yisong Song, Haotian Wu,\nMeihong Wang for product support, and Joseph Laria, Ak-\nshay Hegde, Abha Jain, Raj Ganapathy for assistance with\nprogram management.

GRs를 사용하면 285배 더 복잡한 모델을 사용하면서 추론 컴퓨팅 비용을 줄일 수 있습니다. GRs와 HSTU는 생산 환경에서 12.4%의 메트릭 개선을 가져왔으며, 전통적인 DLRM에 비해 우수한 확장 성능을 보여줍니다. 우리의 결과는 사용자 행동이 생성 모델링에서 소외된 모다리임을 뒷받침하며, 제목처럼 “행동은 말보다 낫다”는 것을 반영합니다. 우리의 작업에서 특징의 극적인 단순화는 추천, 검색 및 광고를 위한 최초의 기반 모델을 위한 길을 열어줍니다. 이는 도메인 간에 단일 특징 공간을 활용할 수 있도록 합니다. GRs의 완전한 순차적 설정은 추천이 엔드투엔드, 생성적인 방식으로 구성되도록 합니다. 이러한 기능들은 추천 시스템이 사용자에게 보다 전체적으로 도움을 줄 수 있도록 합니다.\n\n9\n\n행동은 말보다 낫다: 생성 추천을 위한 순차적 트랜스듀서\n\n영향 평가\n\n저희 작업이 추천, 검색 및 광고 시스템에 대한 대규모의 다양한 특징에 대한 의존성을 줄여 이러한 시스템을 훨씬 더 개인 정보 보호 친화적으로 만들고 사용자 경험을 개선할 수 있다고 믿습니다. 순차적 구성으로 추천 시스템이 사용자의 장기적인 결과를 단기적인 결정에 연결하여 추적할 수 있도록 하면 웹 전체에서 사용자 목표를 충족하지 못하는 콘텐츠의 유행을 줄이고 플랫폼의 인센티브를 사용자 가치와 더 잘 일치시킬 수 있습니다. 마지막으로, 기반 모델 및 스케일링 법칙의 적용은 추천, 검색 및 관련 사례에 대한 모델 연구 및 개발과 관련된 탄소 발자국을 줄이는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다.\n\n감사의 글\n\n이 작업은 수백 명의 공동 노력의 결과이며, 다음 기여자의 노력 없이는 불가능했을 것입니다(알파벳 순서): 아드난 아후ন্দ오프, 부그라 아키딜즈, 샤바브 아이유브, 알렉스 바오, 렌킨 카이, 제니퍼 카오, 궈기앙 제시 첸, 레이 첸, 선 첸, 션지예 첸, 휴이휴 쑨, 웨이웨 추, 테드 추이, 시야엔 덩, 니밋 데사이, 페이 딩, 프랑수아 파가, 루 팡, 리장 궈, 리즈 궈, 지완 갸왈리, 유첸 하오, 데이시 쉬 헤, 사무엘 하스야, 쥐화 하오, 얀즈운 황, 홍이 쟈, 루 쑨, 쟈인 윈, 랄흐 킨디, 쑨키우 킴, 예진 리, 푸 리, 홍 리, 셔야 리, 웨이 리, 즈징 리, 쑤에팅 리아오, 에마 린, 하오 린, 징주 류, 싱유 리우, 카이 론덴베르크, 리장 루오, 린지안 마, 맷 마, 윈 마오, 베르트 마허, 매튜 머피, 사티쉬 나다추르, 민 니, 종수 박, 징 첸, 리징 퀸, 알렉스 싱, 타이모시 쉬, 데니스 반 데르 스타이, 시아오 썬, 콜린 테일러, 신예 최, 로한 바르마, 옴카 비차레, 알리사 왕, 팽차오 왕, 성지 왕, 웬팅 왕, 셔롱 왕, 지용 왕, 바이 윈, 카를-쑨 우, 에릭 쑤, 비 쑤에, 정 옌, 추영 양, 주이제 양, 지명 양, 츈싱 윈, 다니엘 윈, 이령 유, 케케 짜이, 옌리 짜오, 즈루안 짜오, 회장 짜오, 징징 짜오, 루 짜오,  lujia 짜오, na 짜오, Rui 짜오, xiong 짜오, ying 짜오, zhiyun 짜오, charles zheng, erheng zhong, xin zhuang.\n\nShikha Kapoor, Rex Cheung, Lana Dam, Ram Ramanathan, Nipun Mathur, Bo Feng, Yanhong Wu, Zhaohui Guo, Hongjie Bai, Wen-Yun Yang, Zellux Wang, Arun Singh, Bruce Deng, Yisong Song, Haotian Wu, Meihong Wang for product support, and Joseph Laria, Akshay Hegde, Abha Jain, Raj Ganapathy for assistance with program management.

DLRMs operate on top of heterogeneous feature spaces using various neural\n15\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nSymbol Description\nX Input to an HSTU layer.

We hence provided an overview of Generative Recommenders\n(GRs) by contrasting them with classical DLRMs explicitly in Section 2 and Section 3. In this section, we give the readers\nan alternative perspective starting from the classical sequential recommender literature.\nB.1. Background: Sequential Recommendations in Academia and Industry\nB.1.1. A CADEMIC RESEARCH (T RADITIONAL SEQUENTIAL RECOMMENDER SETTINGS )\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) were first applied to recommendation scenarios in GRU4Rec (Hidasi et al., 2016).\nHidasi et al. (2016) considered Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and applied them over two datasets, RecSys Challenge 20152\nand VIDEO (a proprietary dataset). In both cases, only positive events (clicked e-commerce items or videos where users\nspent at least a certain amount of time watching) were kept as part of the input sequence. We further observe that in a\nclassical industrial-scale two-stage recommendation system setup consisting of retrieval and ranking stages (Covington\net al., 2016), the task that Hidasi et al. (2016) solved primarily maps to the retrieval task.\nTransformers, sequential transduction architectures, and their variants. Advances in sequential transduction ar-\nchitectures in later years, in particular Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), have motivated similar advancements in\nrecommendation systems. SASRec (Kang & McAuley, 2018) first applied Transformers in an autoregressive setting. They\nconsidered the presence of a review or rating as positive feedback, thereby converting classical datasets like Amazon\nReviews 3 and MovieLens 4 to sequences of positive items, similar to GRU4Rec. A binary cross entropy loss was employed,\nwhere positive target is defined as the next “positive” item (recall this is in essence just presence of a review or rating), and\nnegative target is randomly sampled from the item corpus X = Xc.\n2http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/\n3https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/\n4https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/, https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/\n16\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nMost subsequent research were built upon similar settings as GRU4Rec (Hidasi et al., 2016) and SASRec (Kang & McAuley,\n2018) discussed above, such as BERT4Rec (Sun et al., 2019) applying bidirectional encoder setting from BERT (Devlin\net al., 2019), S3Rec (Zhou et al., 2020) introducing an explicit pre-training stage, and so on.\nB.1.2. I NDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS AS PART OF DEEP LEARNING RECOMMENDATION MODELS (DLRM S).\nSequential approaches, including sequential encoders and pairwise attention modules, have been widely applied in industrial\nsettings due to their ability to enhance user representations as part of DLRMs. DLRMs commonly use relatively small\nsequence lengths, such as 20 in BST (Chen et al., 2019), 1,000 in DIN (Zhou et al., 2018), and 100 in TransAct (Xia et al.,\n2023). We observe that these are 1-3 orders of magnitude smaller compared with 8,192 in this work (Section 4.3).\nDespite using short sequence lengths, most DLRMs can successfully capture long-term user preferences. This can be\nattributed to two key aspects. First, precomputed user profiles/embeddings (Xia et al., 2023) or external vector stores (Chang\net al., 2023) are commonly used in modern DLRMs, both of which effectively extend lookback windows. Second, a\nsignificant number of contextual-, user-, and item-side features were generally employed (Zhou et al., 2018; Chen et al.,\n2019; Chang et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2023) and various heterogeneous networks, such as FMs (Xiao et al., 2017; Guo et al.,\n2017), DCNs (Wang et al., 2021), MoEs, etc. are used to transform representations and combine outputs.\nIn contrast to sequential settings discussed in Appendix B.1.1, all major industrial work defines loss over (user/request,\ncandidate item) pairs. In the ranking setting, a multi-task binary cross-entropy loss is commonly used. In the retrieval setting,\ntwo tower setting (Covington et al., 2016) remains the dominant approach. Recent work has investigated representing the\nnext item to recommend as a probability distribution over a sequence of (sub-)tokens, such as OTM (Zhuo et al., 2020),\nand DR (Gao et al., 2021) (note that in other recent work, the same setting is sometimes denoted as “generative retrieval”).\nThey commonly utilize beam search to decode the item from sub-tokens. Advanced learned similarity functions, such as\nmixture-of-logits (Zhai et al., 2023a), have also been proposed and deployed as an alternative to two-tower setting and beam\nsearch given proliferation of modern accelerators such as GPUs, custom ASICs, and TPUs.\nFrom a problem formulation perspective, we consider all work discussed above part of DLRMs (Mudigere et al., 2022)\ngiven the model architectures, features used, and losses used differ significantly from academic sequential recommender\nresearch discussed in Appendix B.1.1. It’s also worth remarking that there have been no successful applications of fully\nsequential ranking settings in industry, especially not at billion daily active users (DAU) scale, prior to this work.\nB.2. Formulations: Ranking and Retrieval as Sequential Transduction Tasks in Generative Recommenders (GRs)\nWe next discuss three limitations in the traditional sequential recommender settings and DLRM settings, and how Generative\nRecommenders (GRs) address them from a problem formulation perspective.\nIgnorance of features other than user-interacted items. Past sequential formulations only consider contents (items)\nusers explicitly interacted with (Hidasi et al., 2016; Kang & McAuley, 2018; Sun et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020), while\nindustry-scale recommendation systems prior to GRs are trained over a vast number of features to enhance the representation\nof users and contents (Covington et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2023; Xia\net al., 2023; Zhai et al., 2023a). GR addresses this limitation by a) compressing other categorical features and merging them\nwith the main time series, and b) capturing numerical features through cross-attention interaction utilizing a target-aware\nformulation as discussed in Section 2.1 and Figure 2. We validate this by showing that the traditional “interaction-only”\nformulation that ignores such features degrades model quality significantly; experiment results can be found in the rows\nlabeled “GR (interactions only)” in Table 7 and Table 6, where we show utilizing only interaction history led to a 1.3%\ndecrease in hit rate@100 for retrieval and a 2.6% NE decrease in ranking (recall a 0.1% change in NE is significant, as\ndiscussed in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.3.1).\nUser representations are computed in a target-independent setting. A second issue is most traditional sequential\nrecommenders, including GRU4Rec (Hidasi et al., 2016), SASRec (Kang & McAuley, 2018), BERT4Rec (Sun et al., 2019),\nS3Rec (Zhou et al., 2020), etc. are formulated in a target-independent fashion where for a target item Φi, Φ0, Φ1, . . . ,Φi−1\nare used as encoder input to compute user representations, which is then used to provide predictions. In contrast, most major\nDLRM approaches used in industrial settings formulated the sequential modules used in a target-aware fashion, with the\nability to incorporate “target” (ranking candidate) information into the user representations. These include DIN (Zhou et al.,\n2018) (Alibaba), BST (Chen et al., 2019) (Alibaba), TWIN (Chang et al., 2023) (Kwai), and TransAct (Xia et al., 2023)\n(Pinterest).\n17\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nGenerative Recommenders (GRs) combines the best of both worlds by interleaving the content and action sequences\n(Section 2.2) to enable applying target-aware attention in causal, autoregressive settings. We categorize and contrast prior\nwork and this work in Table 10 5.\nInput for target\nitem i\nExpected output\nfor target item i Architecture Training Procedure\nGRs Φ0, a0, Φ1, a1, . . . ,Φi ai (target-aware) Self-attention (HSTU) Causal autoregressive\n(streaming/single-pass)\nGRU4Rec Φ0, Φ1, . . . ,Φi−1 Φi\nRNNs (GRUs) Causal autoregressive\n(multi-pass)SASRec Self-attention (Transformers)\nBERT4Rec Φ0, Φ1, . . . ,Φi−1\n(at inference time) Φi Self-attention (Transformers) Sequential multi-pass 6\nS3Rec\nDIN\nΦ0, Φ1, . . . ,Φi\nai (target aware,\nimplicitly as part\nof DLRMs)\nPairwise attention\nPointwise (generally\nstreaming/single pass)\nBST Self-attention (Transformers)\nTWIN Two-stage pairwise attention\nTransAct (Φ0, a0), . . . ,(Φi−1, ai−1), Φi Self-attention (Transformers)\nTable 10. Comparison of prior work on sequential recommenders and GRs, in the ranking setting, with DLRMs included for completeness.\nDiscriminative formulations restrict applicability of prior sequential recommender work to pointwise settings.Finally,\ntraditional sequential recommenders are discriminative by design. Existing sequential recommender literature, including\nseminal work such as GRU4Rec and SASRec, model p(Φi|Φ0, a0, . . . ,Φi−1, ai−1), or the conditional distribution of the\nnext item to recommend given users’ current states. On the other hand, we observe that there are two probabilistic processes\nin standard recommendation systems, namely the process of the recommendation system suggesting a content Φi (e.g., some\nphoto or video) to the user, and the process of the user reacting to the suggested content Φi via some action ai (which can\nbe a combination of like, video completion, skip, etc.).\nA generative approach needs to model the joint distribution over the sequence of suggested contents and user actions,\nor p(Φ0, a0, Φ1, a1, . . . ,Φnc−1, anc−1), as discussed in Section 2.2. Our proposal of Generative Recommenders enables\nmodeling of such distributions, as shown in Table 11 (Figure 8). Note that the next action token ( ai) prediction task is\nexactly the GR ranking setting discussed in Table 1, whereas the next content (Φi) prediction task is similar to the retrieval\nsetting adapted to the interleaved setting, with the target changed in order to learn the input data distribution.\nTask Specification (Inputs / Outputs / Length)\nNext action token (ai) prediction\nxis Φ0, a0, Φ1, a1, . . . ,Φnc−2, anc−2, Φnc−1, anc−1\nyis a0, ∅, a1, ∅, . . . , anc−2, ∅, anc−1, ∅\nn 2nc\nNext content token (Φi) prediction\nxis Φ0, a0, Φ1, a1, . . . ,Φnc−2, anc−2, Φnc−1, anc−1\nyis ∅, Φ1, ∅, Φ2, . . . ,∅, Φnc−1, ∅, ∅\nn 2nc\nTable 11. Generative modeling over p(Φ0, a0, . . . ,Φnc−1, anc−1). An illustration is provided in Figure 8.\nImportantly, this formulation not only enables proper modeling of data distribution but further enables sampling sequences\nof items to recommend to the user directly via e.g., beam search. We hypothesize that this will lead to a superior approach\ncompared with traditional listwise settings (e.g., DPP (Gillenwater et al., 2014) and RL (Zhao et al., 2018)), and we leave\nthe full formulation and evaluation of such systems (briefly discussed in Section 6) as a future work.\nC. Evaluation: Synthetic Data\nAs previously discussed in Section 3.1, standard softmax attention, due to its normalization factor, makes it challenging\nto capture intensity of user preferences which is important for user representation learning. This aspect is important in\nrecommendation scenarios as the system may need to predict the intensity of engagements (e.g., number of future positive\n5Most large-scale industrial recommenders need to be trained in a streaming/single-pass setting due to vast amount of logged data.\n6BERT4Rec leverages multi-pass training with a mixture of Cloze and pointwise (last item) supervision losses; S3Rec utilizes\nmulti-pass training with pre-training and finetuning as two separate stages.\n18\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nΦ0\n(a0)\nΦ1\n(a1) ... ...Φi\n(ai)\nΦnc-1\n(anc-1)\nΦ1 Φ2 Φi+1\nEmbedding Layers\n(with optional MLPs)\nTraining Input\nToken Sequence\nSupervision (Expected\nNext Item Φi)\nSelf-Attention Block(s)\nPrediction Layer\n... ...\n... ...\n... ...\nEmbedding Layers\nTraining Input\nToken Sequence\nSupervision (Expected\nNext Token Φi/ai)\nSelf-Attention Block(s)\na0 Φ1 a1 anc-1\nΦ0 a0 Φ1 ...

We illustrate sequential\nrecommenders in causal autoregressive settings and GRs without contextual features to facilitate comparison. On the left hand side, the\naction types ais are either ignored or combined with item information Φis using MLPs, before going into self-attention blocks.\nactions on a particular topic) in addition to the relative ordering of items.\nTo understand this behavior, we construct synthetic data following a Dirichlet Process that generates streaming data over a\ndynamic set of vocabulary. Dirichlet Process captures the behavior that ‘rich gets richer‘ in user engagement histories. We\nset up the synthetic experiment as follows:\n• We randomly assign each one of 20,000 item ids to exactly one of 100 categories.\n• We generate 1,000,000 records of length 128 each, with the first 90% being used for training and the final 10% used\nfor testing. To simulate the streaming training setting, we make the initial 40% of item ids available initially and\nthe rest available progressively at equal intervals; i.e., at record 500,000, the maximum id that can be sampled is\n(40% + 60% ∗ 0.5) ∗ 20, 000 = 14, 000.\n• We randomly select up to 5 categories out of 100 for each record and randomly sample a prior Hc over these 5\ncategories. We sequentially sample category for each position following a Dirichlet process over possible categories as\nfollows:\n– for n > 1:\n* with probability α/(α + n − 1), draw category c from Hc.\n* with probability nc/(α + n − 1), draw category c, where nc is the number of previous items with category c.\n* randomly sample an assigned item matching category c subject to streaming constraints.\nwhere α is uniformly sampled at random from (1.0, 500.0).\nThe results can be found in Table 2. We always ablaterabp,t for HSTU as this dataset does not have timestamps. We observe\nHSTU increasing Hit Rate@10 by more than 100% relative to standard Transformers. Importantly, replacing HSTU’s\npointwise attention mechanism with softmax (“HSTU w/ Softmax”) also leads to a significant reduction in hit rate, verifying\nthe importance of pointwise attention-like aggregation mechanisms.\nD. Evaluation: Traditional Sequential Recommender Settings\nOur evaluations in Section 4.1.1 focused on comparing HSTU with a state-of-the-art Transformer baseline, SASRec, utilizing\nlatest training recipe. In this section, we further consider two other alternative approaches.\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs). We consider the classical work on sequential recommender, GRU4Rec (Hidasi et al.,\n2016), to help readers understand how self-attention models, including Transformers and HSTU, compare to traditional\nRNNs, when all the latest modeling and training improvements are fully incorporated.\nSelf-supervised sequential approaches. We consider the most popular work, BERT4Rec (Sun et al., 2019), to understand\nhow bidirectional self-supervision (leveraged in BERT4Rec via a Cloze objective) compares with unidirectional causal\nautoregressive settings, such as SASRec and HSTU.\n19\n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations\nMethod HR@10 HR@50 HR@200 NDCG@10 NDCG@200\nML-1M\nSASRec (2023) .2853 .5474 .7528 .1603 .2498\nBERT4Rec .2843 (-0.4%) – – .1537 (-4.1%) –\nGRU4Rec .2811 (-1.5%) – – .1648 (+2.8%) –\nHSTU .3097 (+8.6%) .5754 (+5.1%) .7716 (+2.5%) .1720 (+7.3%) .2606 (+4.3%)\nHSTU-large .3294 (+15.5%) .5935 (+8.4%) .7839 (+4.1%) .1893 (+18.1%) .2771 (+10.9%)\nML-20M\nSASRec (2023) .2906 .5499 .7655 .1621 .2521\nBERT4Rec .2816 (-3.4%) – – .1703 (+5.1%) –\nGRU4Rec .2813 (-3.2%) – – .1730 (+6.7%) –\nHSTU .3252 (+11.9%) .5885 (+7.0%) .7943 (+3.8%) .1878 (+15.9%) .2774 (+10.0%)\nHSTU-large .3567 (+22.8%) .6149 (+11.8%) .8076 (+5.5%) .2106 (+30.0%) .2971 (+17.9%)\nBooks\nSASRec (2023) .0292 .0729 .1400 .0156 .0350\nHSTU .0404 (+38.4%) .0943 (+29.5%) .1710 (+22.1%) .0219 (+40.6%) .0450 (+28.6%)\nHSTU-large .0469 (+60.6%) .1066 (+46.2%) .1876 (+33.9%) .0257 (+65.8%) .0508 (+45.1%)\nTable 12. Evaluations of methods on public datasets in traditional sequential recommender settings (multi-pass, full-shuffle). Compared\nwith Table 4, two other baselines (GRU4Rec and BERT4Rec) are included for completeness.\nResults are presented in Table 12. We reuse BERT4Rec results and GRU4Rec results on ML-1M and ML-20M as reported\nby Klenitskiy & Vasilev (2023). Given a sampled softmax loss is used, we hold the number of negatives used constant (128\nfor ML-1M, ML-20M and 512 for Amazon Books) to ensure a fair comparison between methods.\nThe results confirm that SASRec remains one of the most competitive approaches in traditional sequential recommendation\nsettings when sampled softmax loss is used (Zhai et al., 2023a; Klenitskiy & Vasilev, 2023), while HSTU significantly\noutperforms evaluated transformers, RNNs, and self-supervised bidirectional transformers.\nE. Evaluation: Traditional DLRM Baselines\nThe DLRM baseline configurations used in Section 4 reflect continued iterations of hundreds of researchers and engineers\nover multiple years and a close approximation of production configurations on a large internet platform with billions of daily\nactive users before HSTUs/GRs were deployed. We give a high level description of the models used below.\nRanking Setting. The baseline ranking model, as described in (Mudigere et al., 2022), employs approximately one thousand\ndense features and fifty sparse features. We incorporated various modeling techniques such as Mixture of Experts (Ma\net al., 2018), variants of Deep & Cross Network (Wang et al., 2021), various sequential recommendation modules including\ntarget-aware pairwise attention (one commonly used variant in industrial settings can be found in (Zhou et al., 2018)), and\nresidual connection over special interaction layers (He et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2022). For the low FLOPs regime in the\nscaling law section (Section 4.3.1), some modules with high computational costs were simplified and/or replaced with other\nstate-of-the-art variants like DCNs to achieve desired FLOPs.\nWhile we cannot disclose the exact settings due to confidentiality considerations, to the best of our knowledge, our baseline\nrepresents one of the best known DLRM approaches when recent research are fully incorporated. To validate this claim and\nto facilitate readers’ understanding, we report a typical setup based on identical features but only utilizing major published\nresults including DIN (Zhou et al., 2018), DCN (Wang et al., 2021), and MMoE (Ma et al., 2018) (“DLRM (DIN+DCN)”)\nin Table 7, with the combined architecture illustrated in Figure 9. This setup significantly underperformed our production\nDLRM setup by 0.71% in NE for the main E-Task and 0.57% in NE for the main C-Task (where 0.1% NE is significant).\nRetrieval Setting. The baseline retrieval model employs a standard two-tower neutral retrieval setting (Covington et al.,\n2016) with mixed in-batch and out-of-batch sampling. The input feature set consists of both high cardinality sparse features\n(e.g., item ids, user ids) and low cardinality sparse features (e.g. languages, topics, interest entities). A stack of feed forward\nlayers with residual connections (He et al., 2015) is used to compress the input features into user and item embeddings.\nFeatures and Sequence Length. The features used in both of the DLRM baselines, including main user interaction history\nthat is utilized by various sequential encoder/pairwise attention modules, are strict supersets of the features used in all GR\ncandidates. This applies to all studies conducted in this paper, including those used in the scaling studies (Section 4.3.1).\n20",

      "abstract": "Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms, like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8% in recommendation accuracy and saves 84.3% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL.

      "abstract": "Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has become new state-of-the-art for collaborative filtering. Nevertheless, the reasons of its effectiveness for recommendation are not well understood. Existing work that adapts GCN to recommendation lacks thorough ablation analyses on GCN, which is originally designed for graph classification tasks and equipped with many neural network operations. However, we empirically find that the two most common designs in GCNs -- feature transformation and nonlinear activation -- contribute little to the performance of collaborative filtering. Even worse, including them adds to the difficulty of training and degrades recommendation performance.   In this work, we aim to simplify the design of GCN to make it more concise and appropriate for recommendation. We propose a new model named LightGCN, including only the most essential component in GCN -- neighborhood aggregation -- for collaborative filtering. Specifically, LightGCN learns user and item embeddings by linearly propagating them on the user-item interaction graph, and uses the weighted sum of the embeddings learned at all layers as the final embedding. Such simple, linear, and neat model is much easier to implement and train, exhibiting substantial improvements (about 16.0\\% relative improvement on average) over Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) -- a state-of-the-art GCN-based recommender model -- under exactly the same experimental setting. Further analyses are provided towards the rationality of the simple LightGCN from both analytical and empirical perspectives.",

          "original": "To alleviate information overload on the web, recommender system\nhas been widely deployed to perform personalized information\nfiltering [7, 45, 46]. The core of recommender system is to predict\nwhether a user will interact with an item, e.g., click, rate, purchase,\namong other forms of interactions. As such, collaborative filtering\n(CF), which focuses on exploiting the past user-item interactions to\nachieve the prediction, remains to be a fundamental task towards\neffective personalized recommendation [10, 19, 28, 39].\nThe most common paradigm for CF is to learn latent features\n(a.k.a. embedding) to represent a user and an item, and perform\nprediction based on the embedding vectors [ 6, 19]. Matrix\nfactorization is an early such model, which directly projects the\nsingle ID of a user to her embedding [26]. Later on, several research\nfind that augmenting user ID with the her interaction history as\nthe input can improve the quality of embedding. For example,\nSVD++ [25] demonstrates the benefits of user interaction history\nin predicting user numerical ratings, and Neural Attentive Item\nSimilarity (NAIS) [ 18] differentiates the importance of items in\nthe interaction history and shows improvements in predicting\nitem ranking. In view of user-item interaction graph, these\nimprovements can be seen as coming from using the subgraph\nstructure of a user — more specifically, her one-hop neighbors — to\nimprove the embedding learning.\nTo deepen the use of subgraph structure with high-hop\nneighbors, Wang et al. [39] recently proposes NGCF and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for CF. It takes inspiration from the\nGraph Convolution Network (GCN) [14, 23], following the same\narXiv:2002.02126v4  [cs.IR]  7 Jul 2020\n\npropagation rule to refine embeddings: feature transformation,\nneighborhood aggregation, and nonlinear activation. Although\nNGCF has shown promising results, we argue that its designs\nare rather heavy and burdensome — many operations are directly\ninherited from GCN without justification. As a result, they are not\nnecessarily useful for the CF task. To be specific, GCN is originally\nproposed for node classification on attributed graph, where each\nnode has rich attributes as input features; whereas in user-item\ninteraction graph for CF, each node (user or item) is only described\nby a one-hot ID, which has no concrete semantics besides being\nan identifier. In such a case, given the ID embedding as the input,\nperforming multiple layers of nonlinear feature transformation —\nwhich is the key to the success of modern neural networks [ 16]\n— will bring no benefits, but negatively increases the difficulty for\nmodel training.\nTo validate our thoughts, we perform extensive ablation studies\non NGCF. With rigorous controlled experiments (on the same data\nsplits and evaluation protocol), we draw the conclusion that the\ntwo operations inherited from GCN — feature transformation and\nnonlinear activation — has no contribution on NGCF’s effectiveness.\nEven more surprising, removing them leads to significant accuracy\nimprovements. This reflects the issues of adding operations that\nare useless for the target task in graph neural network, which not\nonly brings no benefits, but rather degrades model effectiveness.\nMotivated by these empirical findings, we present a new model\nnamed LightGCN, including the most essential component of\nGCN — neighborhood aggregation — for collaborative filtering.\nSpecifically, after associating each user (item) with an ID embedding,\nwe propagate the embeddings on the user-item interaction graph\nto refine them. We then combine the embeddings learned at\ndifferent propagation layers with a weighted sum to obtain the final\nembedding for prediction. The whole model is simple and elegant,\nwhich not only is easier to train, but also achieves better empirical\nperformance than NGCF and other state-of-the-art methods like\nMult-VAE [28].\nTo summarize, this work makes the following main contributions:\n• We empirically show that two common designs in GCN,\nfeature transformation and nonlinear activation, have no\npositive effect on the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.\n• We propose LightGCN, which largely simplifies the model\ndesign by including only the most essential components in\nGCN for recommendation.\n• We empirically compare LightGCN with NGCF by following\nthe same setting and demonstrate substantial improvements.\nIn-depth analyses are provided towards the rationality of\nLightGCN from both technical and empirical perspectives.\n2 PRELIMINARIES\nWe first introduce NGCF [39], a representative and state-of-the-art\nGCN model for recommendation. We then perform ablation studies\non NGCF to judge the usefulness of each operation in NGCF. The\nnovel contribution of this section is to show that the two common\ndesigns in GCNs, feature transformation and nonlinear activation,\nhave no positive effect on collaborative filtering.\nTable 1: Performance of NGCF and its three variants.\nGowalla Amazon-Book\nrecall ndcg recall ndcg\nNGCF 0.1547 0.1307 0.0330 0.0254\nNGCF-f 0.1686 0.1439 0.0368 0.0283\nNGCF-n 0.1536 0.1295 0.0336 0.0258\nNGCF-fn 0.1742 0.1476 0.0399 0.0303\n2.1 NGCF Brief\nIn the initial step, each user and item is associated with an ID\nembedding. Let e(0)\nu denote the ID embedding of user u and e(0)\ni\ndenote the ID embedding of item i. Then NGCF leverages the user-\nitem interaction graph to propagate embeddings as:\ne(k+1)\nu =σ\n\u0010\nW1e(k)\nu +\nX\ni ∈Nu\n1p\n|Nu ||Ni |\n(W1e(k)\ni + W2(e(k)\ni ⊙ e(k)\nu ))\n\u0011\n,\ne(k+1)\ni =σ\n\u0010\nW1e(k)\ni +\nX\nu ∈Ni\n1p\n|Nu ||Ni |\n(W1e(k)\nu + W2(e(k)\nu ⊙ e(k)\ni ))\n\u0011\n,\n(1)\nwhere e(k)\nu and e(k)\ni respectively denote the refined embedding of\nuser u and item i after k layers propagation, σis the nonlinear\nactivation function, Nu denotes the set of items that are interacted\nby user u, Ni denotes the set of users that interact with item i,\nand W1 and W2 are trainable weight matrix to perform feature\ntransformation in each layer. By propagatingL layers, NGCF obtains\nL + 1 embeddings to describe a user (e(0)\nu , e(1)\nu , ..., e(L)\nu ) and an item\n(e(0)\ni , e(1)\ni , ..., e(L)\ni ). It then concatenates these L + 1 embeddings to\nobtain the final user embedding and item embedding, using inner\nproduct to generate the prediction score.\nNGCF largely follows the standard GCN [23], including the use\nof nonlinear activation function σ(·) and feature transformation\nmatrices W1 and W2. However, we argue that the two operations\nare not as useful for collaborative filtering. In semi-supervised\nnode classification, each node has rich semantic features as input,\nsuch as the title and abstract words of a paper. Thus performing\nmultiple layers of nonlinear transformation is beneficial to feature\nlearning. Nevertheless, in collaborative filtering, each node of user-\nitem interaction graph only has an ID as input which has no\nconcrete semantics. In this case, performing multiple nonlinear\ntransformations will not contribute to learn better features; even\nworse, it may add the difficulties to train well. In the next subsection,\nwe provide empirical evidence on this argument.\n2.2 Empirical Explorations on NGCF\nWe conduct ablation studies on NGCF to explore the effect of\nnonlinear activation and feature transformation. We use the codes\nreleased by the authors of NGCF 3, running experiments on the\nsame data splits and evaluation protocol to keep the comparison as\nfair as possible. Since the core of GCN is to refine embeddings by\npropagation, we are more interested in the embedding quality under\nthe same embedding size. Thus, we change the way of obtaining\nfinal embedding from concatenation (i.e., e∗u = e(0)\nu ∥· · · ∥ e(L)\nu ) to\nsum (i.e., e∗u = e(0)\nu + · · ·+ e(L)\nu ). Note that this change has little effect\n3https://github.com/xiangwang1223/neural_graph_collaborative_filtering\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nEpoch\n0.000\n0.005\n0.010\n0.015\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030trainning loss\nGowalla\n(a) Training loss on Gowalla\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nEpoch\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18recall@20\nGowalla\n (b) Testing recall on Gowalla\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175\nEpoch\n0.000\n0.005\n0.010\n0.015\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030trainning loss\nAmazon-Book\n (c) Training loss on Amazon-Book\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175\nEpoch\n0.0200\n0.0225\n0.0250\n0.0275\n0.0300\n0.0325\n0.0350\n0.0375recall@20\nAmazon-Book\n (d) Testing recall on Amazon-Book\nFigure 1: Training curves (training loss and testing recall) of NGCF and its three simplified variants.\non NGCF’s performance, but makes the following ablation studies\nmore indicative of the embedding quality refined by GCN.\nWe implement three simplified variants of NGCF:\n• NGCF-f, which removes the feature transformation matrices W1\nand W2.\n• NGCF-n, which removes the non-linear activation functionσ.\n• NGCF-fn, which removes both the feature transformation\nmatrices and non-linear activation function.\nFor the three variants, we keep all hyper-parameters (e.g.,\nlearning rate, regularization coefficient, dropout ratio, etc.) same as\nthe optimal settings of NGCF. We report the results of the 2-layer\nsetting on the Gowalla and Amazon-Book datasets in Table 1. As\ncan be seen, removing feature transformation (i.e., NGCF-f) leads\nto consistent improvements over NGCF on all three datasets. In\ncontrast, removing nonlinear activation does not affect the accuracy\nthat much. However, if we remove nonlinear activation on the basis\nof removing feature transformation (i.e., NGCF-fn), the performance\nis improved significantly. From these observations, we conclude\nthe findings that:\n(1) Adding feature transformation imposes negative effect on\nNGCF, since removing it in both models of NGCF and NGCF-n\nimproves the performance significantly;\n(2) Adding nonlinear activation affects slightly when feature\ntransformation is included, but it imposes negative effect when\nfeature transformation is disabled.\n(3) As a whole, feature transformation and nonlinear activation\nimpose rather negative effect on NGCF, since by removing them\nsimultaneously, NGCF-fn demonstrates large improvements over\nNGCF (9.57% relative improvement on recall).\nTo gain more insights into the scores obtained in Table 1 and\nunderstand why NGCF deteriorates with the two operations, we\nplot the curves of model status recorded by training loss and testing\nrecall in Figure 1. As can be seen, NGCF-fn achieves a much lower\ntraining loss than NGCF, NGCF-f, and NGCF-n along the whole\ntraining process. Aligning with the curves of testing recall, we\nfind that such lower training loss successfully transfers to better\nrecommendation accuracy. The comparison between NGCF and\nNGCF-f shows the similar trend, except that the improvement\nmargin is smaller.\nFrom these evidences, we can draw the conclusion that\nthe deterioration of NGCF stems from the training difficulty,\nrather than overfitting. Theoretically speaking, NGCF has higher\nrepresentation power than NGCF-f, since setting the weight\nmatrix W1 and W2 to identity matrix I can fully recover\nthe NGCF-f model. However, in practice, NGCF demonstrates\nhigher training loss and worse generalization performance than\nNGCF-f. And the incorporation of nonlinear activation further\naggravates the discrepancy between representation power and\ngeneralization performance. To round out this section, we claim\nthat when designing model for recommendation, it is important\nto perform rigorous ablation studies to be clear about the impact\nof each operation. Otherwise, including less useful operations will\ncomplicate the model unnecessarily, increase the training difficulty,\nand even degrade model effectiveness.",

Driven by\nthese findings, we set the goal of developing a light yet effective\nmodel by including the most essential ingredients of GCN for\nrecommendation. The advantages of being simple are several-\nfold — more interpretable, practically easy to train and maintain,\ntechnically easy to analyze the model behavior and revise it towards\nmore effective directions, and so on.\nIn this section, we first present our designed Light Graph\nConvolution Network (LightGCN) model, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nWe then provide an in-depth analysis of LightGCN to show the\nrationality behind its simple design. Lastly, we describe how to do\nmodel training for recommendation.\n3.1 LightGCN\nThe basic idea of GCN is to learning representation for nodes by\nsmoothing features over the graph [ 23, 40]. To achieve this, it\nperforms graph convolution iteratively, i.e., aggregating the features\nof neighbors as the new representation of a target node. Such\nneighborhood aggregation can be abstracted as:\ne(k+1)\nu = AGG(e(k)\nu , {e(k)\ni : i ∈ Nu }). (2)\nThe AGG is an aggregation function — the core of graph convolution\n— that considers the k-th layer’s representation of the target node\nand its neighbor nodes. Many work have specified the AGG, such\nas the weighted sum aggregator in GIN [42], LSTM aggregator in\nGraphSAGE [14], and bilinear interaction aggregator in BGNN [48]\netc. However, most of the work ties feature transformation or\nnonlinear activation with the AGG function. Although they perform\nwell on node or graph classification tasks that have semantic input\nfeatures, they could be burdensome for collaborative filtering (see\npreliminary results in Section 2.2).\n\n૚\nሺ૛ሻ\n૚\n૝\nሺ૙ሻ\n૚\nሺ૚ሻ\n૚\nሺ૜ሻ\n૝\nሺ૚ሻ\n૝\nሺ૛ሻ\n૝\nሺ૜ሻ\nLight Graph Convolution (LGC)\nൌ૚Normalized Sum\n૚૛\n૚\n૛\nି૚ሻ\n૚\nൌ૚\n૛\n૜\nି૚ሻ\n૛\n૜\nLayer Combination (weighted sum)\n૚\n૛\n૜\n૛૜\nNormalized Sum\n૜\n૜\nି૚ሻ\nPrediction\nneighbors of u1 neighbors of i4\nFigure 2: An illustration of LightGCN model architecture.\nIn LGC, only the normalized sum of neighbor embeddings\nis performed towards next layer; other operations like\nself-connection, feature transformation, and nonlinear\nactivation are all removed, which largely simplifies GCNs.\nIn Layer Combination, we sum over the embeddings at each\nlayer to obtain the final representations.\n3.1.1 Light Graph Convolution (LGC). In LightGCN, we adopt the\nsimple weighted sum aggregator and abandon the use of feature\ntransformation and nonlinear activation. The graph convolution\noperation (a.k.a., propagation rule [39]) in LightGCN is defined as:\ne(k+1)\nu =\nX\ni ∈Nu\n1p\n|Nu |\np\n|Ni |\ne(k)\ni ,\ne(k+1)\ni =\nX\nu ∈Ni\n1p\n|Ni |\np\n|Nu |\ne(k)\nu .\n(3)\nThe symmetric normalization term 1√\n| Nu |\n√\n| Ni |\nfollows the design\nof standard GCN [23], which can avoid the scale of embeddings\nincreasing with graph convolution operations; other choices can\nalso be applied here, such as the L1 norm, while empirically we\nfind this symmetric normalization has good performance (see\nexperiment results in Section 4.4.2).\nIt is worth noting that in LGC, we aggregate only the connected\nneighbors and do not integrate the target node itself (i.e., self-\nconnection). This is different from most existing graph convolution\noperations [14, 23, 36, 39, 48] that typically aggregate extended\nneighbors and need to handle the self-connection specially.\nThe layer combination operation, to be introduced in the next\nsubsection, essentially captures the same effect as self-connections.\nThus, there is no need in LGC to include self-connections.\n3.1.2 Layer Combination and Model Prediction. In LightGCN, the\nonly trainable model parameters are the embeddings at the 0-th\nlayer, i.e., e(0)\nu for all users and e(0)\ni for all items. When they are\ngiven, the embeddings at higher layers can be computed via LGC\ndefined in Equation (3). AfterK layers LGC, we further combine the\nembeddings obtained at each layer to form the final representation\nof a user (an item):\neu =\nKX\nk=0\nαk e(k)\nu ; ei =\nKX\nk=0\nαk e(k)\ni , (4)\nwhereαk ≥ 0 denotes the importance of the k-th layer embedding\nin constituting the final embedding. It can be treated as a hyper-\nparameter to be tuned manually, or as a model parameter (e.g.,\noutput of an attention network [3]) to be optimized automatically.\nIn our experiments, we find that settingαk uniformly as 1/(K + 1)\nleads to good performance in general. Thus we do not design\nspecial component to optimizeαk , to avoid complicating LightGCN\nunnecessarily and to keep its simplicity. The reasons that we\nperform layer combination to get final representations are three-\nfold. (1) With the increasing of the number of layers, the embeddings\nwill be over-smoothed [ 27]. Thus simply using the last layer is\nproblematic. (2) The embeddings at different layers capture different\nsemantics. E.g., the first layer enforces smoothness on users and\nitems that have interactions, the second layer smooths users (items)\nthat have overlap on interacted items (users), and higher-layers\ncapture higher-order proximity [39]. Thus combining them will\nmake the representation more comprehensive. (3) Combining\nembeddings at different layers with weighted sum captures the\neffect of graph convolution with self-connections, an important\ntrick in GCNs (proof sees Section 3.2.1).\nThe model prediction is defined as the inner product of user and\nitem final representations:\nˆyui = eT\nu ei , (5)\nwhich is used as the ranking score for recommendation generation.\n3.1.3 Matrix Form. We provide the matrix form of LightGCN to\nfacilitate implementation and discussion with existing models. Let\nthe user-item interaction matrix be R ∈ RM ×N where M and N\ndenote the number of users and items, respectively, and each entry\nRui is 1 if u has interacted with item i otherwise 0. We then obtain\nthe adjacency matrix of the user-item graph as\nA =\n\u0012 0 R\nRT 0\n\u0013\n, (6)\nLet the 0-th layer embedding matrix be E(0) ∈ R(M+N )×T , where T\nis the embedding size. Then we can obtain the matrix equivalent\nform of LGC as:\nE(k+1) = (D− 1\n2 AD− 1\n2 )E(k), (7)\nwhere D is a (M + N ) ×(M + N ) diagonal matrix, in which each entry\nDii denotes the number of nonzero entries in the i-th row vector\nof the adjacency matrix A (also named as degree matrix). Lastly,\nwe get the final embedding matrix used for model prediction as:\nE =α0E(0) +α1E(1) +α2E(2) + ... +αK E(K)\n=α0E(0) +α1 ˜AE(0) +α2 ˜A2E(0) + ... +αK ˜AK E(0),\n(8)\nwhere ˜A = D− 1\n2 AD− 1\n2 is the symmetrically normalized matrix.\n3.2 Model Analysis\nWe conduct model analysis to demonstrate the rationality behind\nthe simple design of LightGCN. First we discuss the connection\nwith the Simplified GCN (SGCN) [ 40], which is a recent linear\n\nGCN model that integrates self-connection into graph convolution;\nthis analysis shows that by doing layer combination, LightGCN\nsubsumes the effect of self-connection thus there is no need for\nLightGCN to add self-connection in adjacency matrix. Then we\ndiscuss the relation with the Approximate Personalized Propagation\nof Neural Predictions (APPNP) [24], which is recent GCN variant\nthat addresses oversmoothing by inspiring from Personalized\nPageRank [15]; this analysis shows the underlying equivalence\nbetween LightGCN and APPNP, thus our LightGCN enjoys\nthe sames benefits in propagating long-range with controllable\noversmoothing. Lastly we analyze the second-layer LGC to show\nhow it smooths a user with her second-order neighbors, providing\nmore insights into the working mechanism of LightGCN.\n3.2.1 Relation with SGCN. In [ 40], the authors argue the\nunnecessary complexity of GCN for node classfication and propose\nSGCN, which simplifies GCN by removing nonlinearities and\ncollapsing the weight matrices to one weight matrix. The graph\nconvolution in SGCN is defined as4:\nE(k+1) = (D + I)− 1\n2 (A + I)(D + I)− 1\n2 E(k), (9)\nwhere I ∈ R(M+N )×(M+N ) is an identity matrix, which is added on\nA to include self-connections. In the following analysis, we omit the\n(D + I)− 1\n2 terms for simplicity, since they only re-scale embeddings.\nIn SGCN, the embeddings obtained at the last layer are used for\ndownstream prediction task, which can be expressed as:\nE(K) = (A + I)E(K −1) = (A + I)K E(0)\n=\n\u0012K\n0\n\u0013\nE(0) +\n\u0012K\n1\n\u0013\nAE(0) +\n\u0012K\n2\n\u0013\nA2E(0) + ... +\n\u0012K\nK\n\u0013\nAK E(0).\n(10)\nThe above derivation shows that, inserting self-connection into A\nand propagating embeddings on it, is essentially equivalent to a\nweighted sum of the embeddings propagated at each LGC layer.\n3.2.2 Relation with APPNP. In a recent work [ 24], the authors\nconnect GCN with Personalized PageRank [ 15], inspiring from\nwhich they propose a GCN variant named APPNP that can\npropagate long range without the risk of oversmoothing. Inspired by\nthe teleport design in Personalized PageRank, APPNP complements\neach propagation layer with the starting features (i.e., the 0-th layer\nembeddings), which can balance the need of preserving locality\n(i.e., staying close to the root node to alleviate oversmoothing)\nand leveraging the information from a large neighborhood. The\npropagation layer in APPNP is defined as:\nE(k+1) =βE(0) + (1 −β) ˜AE(k), (11)\nwhere βis the teleport probability to control the retaining of\nstarting features in the propagation, and ˜A denotes the normalized\nadjacency matrix. In APPNP, the last layer is used for final\nprediction, i.e.,\nE(K) =βE(0) + (1 −β) ˜AE(K −1),\n=βE(0) +β(1 −β) ˜AE(0) + (1 −β)2 ˜A2E(K −2)\n=βE(0) +β(1 −β) ˜AE(0) +β(1 −β)2 ˜A2E(0) + ... + (1 −β)K ˜AK E(0).\n(12)\n4The weight matrix in SGCN can be absorbed into the 0-th layer embedding parameters,\nthus it is omitted in the analysis.\nAligning with Equation (8), we can see that by setting αk\naccordingly, LightGCN can fully recover the prediction embedding\nused by APPNP. As such, LightGCN shares the strength of APPNP\nin combating oversmoothing — by setting the αproperly, we\nallow using a large K for long-range modeling with controllable\noversmoothing.\nAnother minor difference is that APPNP adds self-connection\ninto the adjacency matrix. However, as we have shown before, this\nis redundant due to the weighted sum of different layers.\n3.2.3 Second-Order Embedding Smoothness. Owing to the linearity\nand simplicity of LightGCN, we can draw more insights into how\ndoes it smooth embeddings. Here we analyze a 2-layer LightGCN\nto demonstrate its rationality. Taking the user side as an example,\nintuitively, the second layer smooths users that have overlap on\nthe interacted items. More concretely, we have:\ne(2)\nu =\nX\ni ∈Nu\n1p\n|Nu |\np\n|Ni |\ne(1)\ni =\nX\ni ∈Nu\n1\n|Ni |\nX\nv ∈Ni\n1p\n|Nu |\np\n|Nv |\ne(0)\nv .\n(13)\nWe can see that, if another userv has co-interacted with the target\nuser u, the smoothness strength of v on u is measured by the\ncoefficient (otherwise 0):\ncv−>u = 1p\n|Nu |\np\n|Nv |\nX\ni ∈Nu ∩Nv\n1\n|Ni | . (14)\nThis coefficient is rather interpretable: the influence of a second-\norder neighbor v on u is determined by 1) the number of co-\ninteracted items, the more the larger; 2) the popularity of the\nco-interacted items, the less popularity (i.e., more indicative of\nuser personalized preference) the larger; and 3) the activity of v,\nthe less active the larger. Such interpretability well caters for the\nassumption of CF in measuring user similarity [2, 37] and evidences\nthe reasonability of LightGCN. Due to the symmetric formulation\nof LightGCN, we can get similar analysis on the item side.\n3.3 Model Training\nThe trainable parameters of LightGCN are only the embeddings of\nthe 0-th layer, i.e.,Θ = {E(0)}; in other words, the model complexity\nis same as the standard matrix factorization (MF). We employ the\nBayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss [32], which is a pairwise\nloss that encourages the prediction of an observed entry to be\nhigher than its unobserved counterparts:\nLBP R = −\nMX\nu=1\nX\ni ∈Nu\nX\nj /∈Nu\nlnσ( ˆyui − ˆyu j) +λ|| E(0)|| 2 (15)\nwhereλcontrols the L2 regularization strength. We employ the\nAdam [ 22] optimizer and use it in a mini-batch manner. We\nare aware of other advanced negative sampling strategies which\nmight improve the LightGCN training, such as the hard negative\nsampling [31] and adversarial sampling [9]. We leave this extension\nin the future since it is not the focus of this work.\nNote that we do not introduce dropout mechanisms, which are\ncommonly used in GCNs and NGCF. The reason is that we do not\nhave feature transformation weight matrices in LightGCN, thus\nenforcing L2 regularization on the embedding layer is sufficient\nto prevent overfitting. This showcases LightGCN’s advantages of\nbeing simple — it is easier to train and tune than NGCF which\n\nTable 2: Statistics of the experimented data.\nDataset User # Item # Interaction # Density\nGowalla 29, 858 40, 981 1, 027, 370 0.00084\nYelp2018 31, 668 38, 048 1, 561, 406 0.00130\nAmazon-Book 52, 643 91, 599 2, 984, 108 0.00062\nadditionally requires to tune two dropout ratios (node dropout and\nmessage dropout) and normalize the embedding of each layer to\nunit length.\nMoreover, it is technically viable to also learn the layer\ncombination coefficients {αk }K\nk=0, or parameterize them with an\nattention network. However, we find that learningαon training\ndata does not lead improvement. This is probably because the\ntraining data does not contain sufficient signal to learn goodαthat\ncan generalize to unknown data. We have also tried to learnαfrom\nvalidation data, as inspired by [5] that learns hyper-parameters on\nvalidation data. The performance is slightly improved (less than1%).\nWe leave the exploration of optimal settings ofα(e.g., personalizing\nit for different users and items) as future work.",

As the comparison is done on the same\ndatasets under the same evaluation protocol, we do not further\ncompare with these methods. In addition to NGCF, we further\ncompare with two relevant and competitive CF methods:\n• Mult-VAE [28]. This is an item-based CF method based on the\nvariational autoencoder (VAE). It assumes the data is generated\nfrom a multinomial distribution and using variational inference\nfor parameter estimation. We run the codes released by the\nauthors5, tuning the dropout ratio in [0, 0.2, 0.5], and the βin\n[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]. The model architecture is the suggested one in\nthe paper: 600 → 200 → 600.\n• GRMF [30]. This method smooths matrix factorization by adding\nthe graph Laplacian regularizer. For fair comparison on item\nrecommendation, we change the rating prediction loss to BPR\nloss. The objective function of GRMF is:\nL = −\nMX\nu=1\nX\ni ∈Nu\n\u0010 X\nj /∈Nu\nlnσ(eT\nu ei − eT\nu ej ) +λд|| eu − ei || 2\n\u0011\n+λ|| E|| 2,\n(16)\nwhere λдis searched in the range of [1e−5, 1e−4, ..., 1e−1].\nMoreover, we compare with a variant that adds normalization\nto graph Laplacian: λд|| eu√\n| Nu |\n− ei√\n| Ni |\n|| 2, which is termed\nas GRMF-norm. Other hyper-parameter settings are same as\nLightGCN. The two GRMF methods benchmark the performance\nof smoothing embeddings via Laplacian regularizer, while our\nLightGCN achieves embedding smoothing in the predictive\nmodel.\n4.1.2 Hyper-parameter Settings. Same as NGCF, the embedding\nsize is fixed to 64 for all models and the embedding parameters are\ninitialized with the Xavier method [ 12]. We optimize LightGCN\nwith Adam [22] and use the default learning rate of 0.001 and default\nmini-batch size of 1024 (on Amazon-Book, we increase the mini-\nbatch size to 2048 for speed). The L2 regularization coefficientλis\nsearched in the range of {1e−6, 1e−5, ..., 1e−2}, and in most cases\nthe optimal value is 1e−4. The layer combination coefficientαk is\nuniformly set to 1\n1+K where K is the number of layers. We testK in\nthe range of 1 to 4, and satisfactory performance can be achieved\nwhen K equals to 3. The early stopping and validation strategies\nare the same as NGCF. Typically, 1000 epochs are sufficient for\nLightGCN to converge. Our implementations are available in both\nTensorFlow6 and PyTorch7.\n4.2 Performance Comparison with NGCF\nWe perform detailed comparison with NGCF, recording the\nperformance at different layers (1 to 4) in Table 4, which also shows\nthe percentage of relative improvement on each metric. We further\nplot the training curves of training loss and testing recall in Figure 3\nto reveal the advantages of LightGCN and to be clear of the training\nprocess. The main observations are as follows:\n• In all cases, LightGCN outperforms NGCF by a large margin. For\nexample, on Gowalla the highest recall reported in the NGCF\npaper is 0.1570, while our LightGCN can reach 0.1830 under\nthe 4-layer setting, which is 16.56% higher. On average, the\nrecall improvement on the three datasets is 16.52% and the ndcg\nimprovement is 16.87%, which are rather significant.\n• Aligning Table 4 with Table 1 in Section 2, we can see that\nLightGCN performs better than NGCF-fn, the variant of NGCF\nthat removes feature transformation and nonlinear activation. As\nNGCF-fn still contains more operations than LightGCN (e.g., self-\nconnection, the interaction between user embedding and item\n5https://github.com/dawenl/vae_cf\n6https://github.com/kuandeng/LightGCN\n7https://github.com/gusye1234/pytorch-light-gcn\n\nTable 3: Performance comparison between NGCF and LightGCN at different layers.\nDataset Gowalla Yelp2018 Amazon-Book\nLayer # Method recall ndcg recall ndcg recall ndcg\n1 Layer NGCF 0.1556 0.1315 0.0543 0.0442 0.0313 0.0241\nLightGCN 0.1755(+12.79%) 0.1492(+13.46%) 0.0631(+16.20%) 0.0515(+16.51%) 0.0384(+22.68%) 0.0298(+23.65%)\n2 Layers NGCF 0.1547 0.1307 0.0566 0.0465 0.0330 0.0254\nLightGCN 0.1777(+14.84%) 0.1524(+16.60%) 0.0622(+9.89%) 0.0504(+8.38%) 0.0411(+24.54%) 0.0315(+24.02%)\n3 Layers NGCF 0.1569 0.1327 0.0579 0.0477 0.0337 0.0261\nLightGCN 0.1823(+16.19%) 0.1555(+17.18%) 0.0639(+10.38%) 0.0525(+10.06%) 0.0410(+21.66%) 0.0318(+21.84%)\n4 Layers NGCF 0.1570 0.1327 0.0566 0.0461 0.0344 0.0263\nLightGCN 0.1830(+16.56%) 0.1550(+16.80%) 0.0649(+14.58%) 0.0530(+15.02%) 0.0406(+17.92%) 0.0313(+18.92%)\n*The scores of NGCF on Gowalla and Amazon-Book are directly copied from Table 3 of the NGCF paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08108)\n0 200 400 600 800\nEpoch\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06Training-Loss\nGowalla\n0 200 400 600 800\nEpoch\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18recall@20\nGowalla\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nEpoch\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05Training-Loss\nAmazon-Book\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nEpoch\n0.010\n0.015\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040recall@20\nAmazon-Book\nFigure 3: Training curves of LightGCN and NGCF, which are evaluated by training loss and testing recall per 20 epochs on\nGowalla and Amazon-Book (results on Yelp2018 show exactly the same trend which are omitted for space).\nembedding in graph convolution, and dropout), this suggests that\nthese operations might also be useless for NGCF-fn.\n• Increasing the number of layers can improve the performance, but\nthe benefits diminish. The general observation is that increasing\nthe layer number from 0 (i.e., the matrix factorization model,\nresults see [39]) to 1 leads to the largest performance gain, and\nusing a layer number of 3 leads to satisfactory performance in\nmost cases. This observation is consistent with NGCF’s finding.\n• Along the training process, LightGCN consistently obtains\nlower training loss, which indicates that LightGCN fits the\ntraining data better than NGCF. Moreover, the lower training\nloss successfully transfers to better testing accuracy, indicating\nthe strong generalization power of LightGCN. In contrast, the\nhigher training loss and lower testing accuracy of NGCF reflect\nthe practical difficulty to train such a heavy model it well. Note\nthat in the figures we show the training process under the optimal\nhyper-parameter setting for both methods. Although increasing\nthe learning rate of NGCF can decrease its training loss (even\nlower than that of LightGCN), the testing recall could not be\nimproved, as lowering training loss in this way only finds trivial\nsolution for NGCF.\n4.3 Performance Comparison with\nState-of-the-Arts\nTable 4 shows the performance comparison with competing\nmethods. We show the best score we can obtain for each method.\nWe can see that LightGCN consistently outperforms other methods\non all three datasets, demonstrating its high effectiveness with\nsimple yet reasonable designs. Note that LightGCN can be further\nimproved by tuning the αk (see Figure 4 for an evidence), while\nhere we only use a uniform setting of 1\nK+1 to avoid over-tuning it.\nAmong the baselines, Mult-VAE exhibits the strongest performance,\nwhich is better than GRMF and NGCF. The performance of GRMF is\non a par with NGCF, being better than MF, which admits the utility\nof enforcing embedding smoothness with Laplacian regularizer.\nBy adding normalization into the Laplacian regularizer, GRMF-\nnorm betters than GRMF on Gowalla, while brings no benefits on\nYelp2018 and Amazon-Book.\nTable 4: The comparison of overall performance among\nLightGCN and competing methods.\nDataset Gowalla Yelp2018 Amazon-Book\nMethod recall ndcg recall ndcg recall ndcg\nNGCF 0.1570 0.1327 0.0579 0.0477 0.0344 0.0263\nMult-VAE 0.1641 0.1335 0.0584 0.0450 0.0407 0.0315\nGRMF 0.1477 0.1205 0.0571 0.0462 0.0354 0.0270\nGRMF-norm 0.1557 0.1261 0.0561 0.0454 0.0352 0.0269\nLightGCN 0.1830 0.1554 0.0649 0.0530 0.0411 0.0315\n4.4 Ablation and Effectiveness Analyses\nWe perform ablation studies on LightGCN by showing how\nlayer combination and symmetric sqrt normalization affect its\nperformance. To justify the rationality of LightGCN as analyzed\nin Section 3.2.3, we further investigate the effect of embedding\nsmoothness — the key reason of LightGCN’s effectiveness.\n4.4.1 Impact of Layer Combination. Figure 4 shows the results of\nLightGCN and its variant LightGCN-single that does not use layer\ncombination (i.e., E(K) is used for final prediction for a K-layer\nLightGCN). We omit the results on Yelp2018 due to space limitation,\nwhich show similar trend with Amazon-Book.

The peak point is on layer 2 in most cases, while after that\nit drops quickly to the worst point of layer 4. This indicates that\nsmoothing a node’s embedding with its first-order and second-\norder neighbors is very useful for CF, but will suffer from over-\nsmoothing issues when higher-order neighbors are used.\n• Focusing on LightGCN, we find that its performance gradually\nimproves with the increasing of layers. Even using 4 layers,\nLightGCN’s performance is not degraded. This justifies the\neffectiveness of layer combination for addressing over-smoothing,\nas we have technically analyzed in Section 3.2.2 (relation with\nAPPNP).\n• Comparing the two methods, we find that LightGCN consistently\noutperforms LightGCN-single on Gowalla, but not on Amazon-\nBook and Yelp2018 (where the 2-layer LightGCN-single performs\nthe best). Regarding this phenomenon, two points need to be\nnoted before we draw conclusion: 1) LightGCN-single is special\ncase of LightGCN that setsαK to 1 and otherαk to 0; 2) we do\nnot tune theαk and simply set it as 1\nK+1 uniformly for LightGCN.\nAs such, we can see the potential of further enhancing the\nperformance of LightGCN by tuningαk .\n4.4.2 Impact of Symmetric Sqrt Normalization. In LightGCN,\nwe employ symmetric sqrt normalization 1√\n| Nu |\n√\n| Ni |\non each\nneighbor embedding when performing neighborhood aggregation\n(cf. Equation (3)). To study its rationality, we explore different\nchoices here. We test the use of normalization only at the left\nside (i.e., the target node’s coefficient) and the right side (i.e., the\nneighbor node’s coefficient). We also test L1 normalization, i.e.,\nremoving the square root. Note that if removing normalization,\nthe training becomes numerically unstable and suffers from not-\na-value (NAN) issues, so we do not show this setting. Table 5\nTable 6: Smoothness loss of the embeddings learned by\nLightGCN and MF (the lower the smoother).\nDataset Gowalla Yelp2018 Amazon-book\nSmoothness of User Embeddings\nMF 15449.3 16258.2 38034.2\nLightGCN-single 12872.7 10091.7 32191.1\nSmoothness of Item Embeddings\nMF 12106.7 16632.1 28307.9\nLightGCN-single 5829.0 6459.8 16866.0\nshows the results of the 3-layer LightGCN. We have the following\nobservations:\n• The best setting in general is using sqrt normalization at both\nsides (i.e., the current design of LightGCN). Removing either side\nwill drop the performance largely.\n• The second best setting is using L1 normalization at the left side\nonly (i.e., LightGCN-L1-L). This is equivalent to normalize the\nadjacency matrix as a stochastic matrix by the in-degree.\n• Normalizing symmetrically on two sides is helpful for the\nsqrt normalization, but will degrade the performance of L1\nnormalization.\n4.4.3 Analysis of Embedding Smoothness. As we have analyzed\nin Section 3.2.3, a 2-layer LightGCN smooths a user’s embedding\nbased on the users that have overlap on her interacted items, and\nthe smoothing strength between two users cv→u is measured in\nEquation (14). We speculate that such smoothing of embeddings is\nthe key reason of LightGCN’s effectiveness. To verify this, we first\ndefine the smoothness of user embeddings as:\nSU =\nMX\nu=1\nMX\nv=1\ncv→u( eu\n|| eu || 2 − ev\n|| ev || 2 )2, (17)\nwhere the L2 norm on embeddings is used to eliminate the\nimpact of the embedding’s scale. Similarly we can obtained the\ndefinition for item embeddings. Table 6 shows the smoothness\nof two models, matrix factorization (i.e., using the E(0) for model\nprediction) and the 2-layer LightGCN-single (i.e., using the E(2) for\nprediction). Note that the 2-layer LightGCN-single outperforms\nMF in recommendation accuracy by a large margin. As can be\nseen, the smoothness loss of LightGCN-single is much lower\nthan that of MF. This indicates that by conducting light graph\nconvolution, the embeddings become smoother and more suitable\nfor recommendation.\n\n0 1e-6 1e-5 1e-4 1e-3 1e-2\nRegularization\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050\n0.055\n0.060recall@20\n0 1e-6 1e-5 1e-4 1e-3 1e-2\nRegularization\n0.010\n0.015\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050ndcg@20\nFigure 5: Performance of 2-layer LightGCN w.r.t. different\nregularization coefficientλon Yelp and Amazon-Book.\n4.5 Hyper-parameter Studies\nWhen applying LightGCN to a new dataset, besides the standard\nhyper-parameter learning rate, the most important hyper-parameter\nto tune is the L2 regularization coefficientλ. Here we investigate\nthe performance change of LightGCN w.r.t.λ.\nAs shown in Figure 5, LightGCN is relatively insensitive to λ\n— even when λsets to 0, LightGCN is better than NGCF, which\nadditionally uses dropout to prevent overfitting8. This shows that\nLightGCN is less prone to overfitting — since the only trainable\nparameters in LightGCN are ID embeddings of the 0-th layer,\nthe whole model is easy to train and to regularize. The optimal\nvalue for Yelp2018, Amazon-Book, and Gowalla is 1e−3, 1e−4, and\n1e−4, respectively. When λis larger than 1e−3, the performance\ndrops quickly, which indicates that too strong regularization will\nnegatively affect model normal training and is not encouraged.",

          "original": "5.1 Collaborative Filtering\nCollaborative Filtering (CF) is a prevalent technique in modern\nrecommender systems [ 7, 45]. One common paradigm of CF\nmodel is to parameterize users and items as embeddings, and\nlearn the embedding parameters by reconstructing historical user-\nitem interactions. For example, earlier CF models like matrix\nfactorization (MF) [ 26, 32] project the ID of a user (or an item)\ninto an embedding vector. The recent neural recommender models\nlike NCF [19] and LRML [34] use the same embedding component,\nwhile enhance the interaction modeling with neural networks.\nBeyond merely using ID information, another type of CF methods\nconsiders historical items as the pre-existing features of a user,\ntowards better user representations. For example, FISM [21] and\nSVD++ [ 25] use the weighted average of the ID embeddings\nof historical items as the target user’s embedding. Recently,\nresearchers realize that historical items have different contributions\nto shape personal interest. Towards this end, attention mechanisms\nare introduced to capture the varying contributions, such as\nACF [3] and NAIS [ 18], to automatically learn the importance\nof each historical item. When revisiting historical interactions as\na user-item bipartite graph, the performance improvements can\nbe attributed to the encoding of local neighborhood — one-hop\nneighbors — that improves the embedding learning.\n8Note that Gowalla shows the same trend with Amazon-Book, so its curves are not\nshown to better highlight the trend of Yelp2018 and Amazon-Book.\n5.2 Graph Methods for Recommendation\nAnother relevant research line is exploiting the user-item graph\nstructure for recommendation. Prior efforts like ItemRank [ 13],\nuse the label propagation mechanism to directly propagate user\npreference scores over the graph,i.e., encouraging connected nodes\nto have similar labels. Recently emerged graph neural networks\n(GNNs) shine a light on modeling graph structure, especially high-\nhop neighbors, to guide the embedding learning [ 14, 23]. Early\nstudies define graph convolution on the spectral domain, such as\nLaplacian eigen-decomposition [1] and Chebyshev polynomials [8],\nwhich are computationally expensive. Later on, GraphSage [14] and\nGCN [23] re-define graph convolution in the spatial domain, i.e.,\naggregating the embeddings of neighbors to refine the target node’s\nembedding. Owing to its interpretability and efficiency, it quickly\nbecomes a prevalent formulation of GNNs and is being widely\nused [11, 29, 47]. Motivated by the strength of graph convolution,\nrecent efforts like NGCF [39], GC-MC [35], and PinSage [45] adapt\nGCN to the user-item interaction graph, capturing CF signals in\nhigh-hop neighbors for recommendation.\nIt is worth mentioning that several recent efforts provide deep\ninsights into GNNs [ 24, 27, 40], which inspire us developing\nLightGCN. Particularly, Wu et al. [ 40] argues the unnecessary\ncomplexity of GCN, developing a simplified GCN (SGCN) model\nby removing nonlinearities and collapsing multiple weight\nmatrices into one. One main difference is that LightGCN and\nSGCN are developed for different tasks, thus the rationality of\nmodel simplification is different. Specifically, SGCN is for node\nclassification, performing simplification for model interpretability\nand efficiency. In contrast, LightGCN is on collaborative filtering\n(CF), where each node has an ID feature only. Thus, we do\nsimplification for a stronger reason: nonlinearity and weight\nmatrices are useless for CF, and even hurt model training. For node\nclassification accuracy, SGCN is on par with (sometimes weaker\nthan) GCN. While for CF accuracy, LightGCN outperforms GCN by\na large margin (over 15% improvement over NGCF). Lastly, another\nwork conducted in the same time [4] also finds that the nonlinearity\nis unnecessary in NGCF and develops linear GCN model for CF. In\ncontrast, our LightGCN makes one step further — we remove all\nredundant parameters and retain only the ID embeddings, making\nthe model as simple as MF.\n6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this work, we argued the unnecessarily complicated design of\nGCNs for collaborative filtering, and performed empirical studies\nto justify this argument. We proposed LightGCN which consists\nof two essential components — light graph convolution and\nlayer combination. In light graph convolution, we discard feature\ntransformation and nonlinear activation — two standard operations\nin GCNs but inevitably increase the training difficulty. In layer\ncombination, we construct a node’s final embedding as the weighted\nsum of its embeddings on all layers, which is proved to subsume the\neffect of self-connections and is helpful to control oversmoothing.\nWe conduct experiments to demonstrate the strengths of LightGCN\nin being simple: easier to be trained, better generalization ability,\nand more effective.\n\nWe believe the insights of LightGCN are inspirational to future\ndevelopments of recommender models. With the prevalence of\nlinked graph data in real applications, graph-based models are\nbecoming increasingly important in recommendation; by explicitly\nexploiting the relations among entities in the predictive model, they\nare advantageous to traditional supervised learning scheme like\nfactorization machines [17, 33] that model the relations implicitly.\nFor example, a recent trend is to exploit auxiliary information such\nas item knowledge graph [38], social network [41] and multimedia\ncontent [44] for recommendation, where GCNs have set up the\nnew state-of-the-art. However, these models may also suffer from\nthe similar issues of NGCF since the user-item interaction graph is\nalso modeled by same neural operations that may be unnecessary.\nWe plan to explore the idea of LightGCN in these models. Another\nfuture direction is to personalize the layer combination weightsαk ,\nso as to enable adaptive-order smoothing for different users (e.g.,\nsparse users may require more signal from higher-order neighbors\nwhile active users require less). Lastly, we will explore further the\nstrengths of LightGCN’s simplicity, studying whether fast solution\nexists for non-sampling regression loss [20] and streaming it for\nonline industrial scenarios.\nAcknowledgement.

CF 모델의 일반적인 패러다임 중 하나는 사용자 및 아이템을 임베딩으로 파라미터화하고, 역사적 사용자-아이템 상호작용을 재구성하여 임베딩 파라미터를 학습하는 것입니다. 예를 들어, 이전 CF 모델인 행렬 분해 (MF) [ 26, 32]는 사용자 (또는 아이템)의 ID를 임베딩 벡터로 투영합니다. 최근  신경 추천 모델인 NCF [19] 및 LRML [34]는 동일한 임베딩 구성 요소를 사용하면서 신경망을 사용하여 상호작용 모델링을 향상시킵니다. ID 정보를 단순히 사용하는 것 외에도, 다른 유형의 CF 방법은 역사적 아이템을 사용자의 기존 특징으로 고려하여 사용자 표현을 개선합니다. 예를 들어, FISM [21] 및 SVD++ [ 25]는 역사적 아이템의 가중 평균을 대상 사용자의 임베딩으로 사용합니다. 최근 연구자들은 역사적 아이템이 개인적인 관심을 형성하는 데 서로 다른 기여를 한다는 것을 인식하게 되었습니다. 이러한 목표를 달성하기 위해, ACF [3] 및 NAIS [ 18]와 같은 주의 메커니즘이 서로 다른 기여를 자동으로 학습하기 위해 도입되었습니다. 사용자-아이템 이분 그래프로 역사적 상호작용을 재방문할 때 성능 개선은 한-홉 이웃을 인코딩하여 임베딩 학습을 개선했기 때문에 발생합니다.\n\n8Note that Gowalla shows the same trend with Amazon-Book, so its curves are not\nshown to better highlight the trend of Yelp2018 and Amazon-Book.\n\n**5.2 Graph Methods for Recommendation**\n\n또 다른 관련 연구 분야는 추천을 위해 사용자-아이템 그래프 구조를 활용하는 것입니다. ItemRank [ 13]와 같은 이전 노력은 그래프를 통해 사용자 선호도 점수를 직접 전파하는 레이블 전파 메커니즘을 사용하여 이를 수행했습니다. 즉, 연결된 노드가 유사한 레이블을 갖도록 장려합니다. 최근 등장한 그래프 신경망 (GNNs)는 특히 고-홉 이웃을 모델링하여 임베딩 학습을 안내하는 그래프 구조, 특히 모델링에 큰 빛을 비춥니다 [ 14, 23]. 초기 연구에서는 스펙트럼 영역에서 그래프 공변화를 정의했습니다. 즉, 라플라시안 자명값 분해 [1] 및 체비셰프 다항식 [8]을 사용하여 계산 비용이 많이 듭니다. 나중에, GraphSage [14] 및 GCN [23]는 공간 영역에서 그래프 공변화를 재정의했습니다. 즉, 대상 노드의 임베딩을 개선하기 위해 이웃의 임베딩을 집계합니다. 해석 가능성과 효율성 때문에, GNN의 일반적인 형태로 빠르게 자리 잡았으며 널리 사용되고 있습니다 [11, 29, 47]. 그래프 공변화의 강도를 바탕으로, NGCF [39], GC-MC [35], 및 PinSage [45]와 같은 최근 노력은 사용자-아이템 상호작용 그래프를 사용하여 CF 신호를 고-홉 이웃에서 캡처하여 추천을 수행합니다.\n\n여러 최근 노력이 GNN에 대한 깊은 통찰력을 제공한다는 점에 주목할 만합니다 [ 24, 27, 40], 이는 LightGCN을 개발하는 데 영감을 주었습니다. 특히, Wu et al. [ 40]는 GCN의 불필요한 복잡성을 주장하고 비선형성 및 여러 가중 행렬을 하나의 행렬로 합산하여 모델 단순화를 통해 SGCN 모델을 개발했습니다. 주요 차이점은 LightGCN과 SGCN이 서로 다른 작업에 대해 개발되었다는 것입니다. 따라서 모델 단순화의 타당성은 다릅니다. 구체적으로, SGCN은 노드 분류를 위한 것이며, 모델 해석 가능성과 효율성을 위해 단순화를 수행합니다. 반대로, LightGCN은 협업 필터링 (CF)에 있으며, 각 노드는 ID 기능만 갖습니다. 따라서 우리는 더 강력한 이유로 단순화를 수행합니다. 비선형성과 가중 행렬은 CF에 쓸모없고 심지어 모델 훈련을 저해합니다. 노드 분류 정확도에 대해, SGCN은 (때로는 GCN보다 낮을 수 있는) GCN과 일치합니다. 그러나 CF 정확도에 대해, LightGCN은 NGCF보다 훨씬 더 큰 마진 (NGCF보다 15% 이상의 개선)으로 성능을 능가합니다. 마지막으로, 같은 시기에 수행된 다른 작업 [4]도 NGCF에서 비선형성이 불필요하다는 것을 발견하고 CF에 대한 선형 GCN 모델을 개발했습니다. 대조적으로, LightGCN은 한 걸음 더 나아가 모든 중복 매개변수를 제거하고 ID 임베딩만 유지하여 모델을 MF와 같이 단순하게 만듭니다.\n\n6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\n\n이 작업에서 우리는 협업 필터링에 대한 GCN의 불필요하게 복잡한 설계를 주장하고, 이를 정당화하기 위해 경험적 연구를 수행했습니다. 우리는 LightGCN을 제안했는데, 이는 가벼운 그래프 공변화 및 레이어 결합의 두 가지 필수 구성 요소로 구성됩니다. 가벼운 그래프 공변화에서, 우리는 표준 GCN에서 일반적으로 사용되는 기능 변환 및 비선형 활성화와 같이 두 가지 표준 작업을 제거하여 훈련 난이도를 증가시킵니다. 레이어 결합에서, 우리는 모든 레이어의 임베딩을 가중 평균하여 대상 노드의 임베딩으로 구성합니다. 이는 자가 연결 효과를 subsume하고 과도한 매끄러움 통제를 돕는 것으로 증명되었으며, 이는 더 나은 일반화 능력과 더 효과적인 학습을 제공합니다.\n\n우리는 LightGCN이 단순함 (더 쉽게 훈련할 수 있음, 더 나은 일반화 능력, 더 효과적임)에서 강점을 보여주는 것을 믿습니다.\n\n우리는 LightGCN의 통찰력이 추천 모델의 미래 개발에 영감을 줄 것이라고 믿습니다. 링크된 gr"

      "abstract": "To provide more accurate, diverse, and explainable recommendation, it is compulsory to go beyond modeling user-item interactions and take side information into account. Traditional methods like factorization machine (FM) cast it as a supervised learning problem, which assumes each interaction as an independent instance with side information encoded. Due to the overlook of the relations among instances or items (e.g., the director of a movie is also an actor of another movie), these methods are insufficient to distill the collaborative signal from the collective behaviors of users. In this work, we investigate the utility of knowledge graph (KG), which breaks down the independent interaction assumption by linking items with their attributes. We argue that in such a hybrid structure of KG and user-item graph, high-order relations --- which connect two items with one or multiple linked attributes --- are an essential factor for successful recommendation. We propose a new method named Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) which explicitly models the high-order connectivities in KG in an end-to-end fashion. It recursively propagates the embeddings from a node's neighbors (which can be users, items, or attributes) to refine the node's embedding, and employs an attention mechanism to discriminate the importance of the neighbors. Our KGAT is conceptually advantageous to existing KG-based recommendation methods, which either exploit high-order relations by extracting paths or implicitly modeling them with regularization. Empirical results on three public benchmarks show that KGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Neural FM and RippleNet. Further studies verify the efficacy of embedding propagation for high-order relation modeling and the interpretability benefits brought by the attention mechanism.",

KG는 속성을 통해 아이템을 연결함으로써 독립적인 상호작용 가정에 도전합니다.  KG와 사용자-아이템 그래프의 이러한 하이브리드 구조에서 두 아이템을 연결하는 하나 이상의 연결된 속성을 통해 나타나는 고차원 관계는 성공적인 추천에 필수적인 요소라는 주장을 펼칩니다.  저희는 지식 그래프 어텐션 네트워크(KGAT)라는 새로운 방법을 제안합니다. KG 내의 고차원 연결성을 전이 학습 방식으로 명시적으로 모델링합니다.  KG의 노드 이웃(사용자, 아이템 또는 속성)에서 임베딩을 재귀적으로 전파하여 노드의 임베딩을 개선하고, 이웃의 중요도를 구별하기 위해 어텐션 메커니즘을 사용합니다.  저희의 KGAT는 기존 KG 기반 추천 방법보다 개념적으로 유리하며, 고차원 관계를 추출하여 경로를 활용하거나 정규화로 암시적으로 모델링하는 방식에 의존합니다.  세 가지 공개 벤치마크에 대한 실험 결과에 따르면 KGAT는 Neural FM 및 RippleNet과 같은 최첨단 방법보다 훨씬 뛰어난 성능을 보입니다.  추가 연구는 고차원 관계 모델링에 대한 임베딩 전파의 효능과 어텐션 메커니즘으로 가져오는 해석 가능성에 대한 효과를 확인합니다."

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of deep residual networks hinges on the identity shortcut connection. While this mechanism alleviates the vanishing-gradient problem, it also has a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, limiting the network's ability to model complex hidden state transitions. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Deep Delta Learning (DDL)}, which generalizes the shortcut from a fixed identity map to a learnable, state-dependent linear operator. The resulting Delta Operator is a rank-1 perturbation of the identity, $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\mathbf{I}- β(\\mathbf{X})\\mathbf{k} (\\mathbf{X}) \\mathbf{k} (\\mathbf{X})^\\top$, parameterized by a unit direction $\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{X})$ and a scalar gate $β(\\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis showing that $β(\\mathbf{X})$ continuously interpolates the shortcut between identity ($β=0$), orthogonal projection ($β=1$), and Householder reflection ($β=2$). Furthermore, we rewrite the residual update as a synchronized rank-1 delta write: $β$ scales both the removal of the current $\\mathbf{k}$-component and the injection of the new $\\mathbf{k}$-component. This unification enables explicit control of the shortcut spectrum along a data-dependent direction while retaining stable training behavior. Empirically, replacing Transformer residual additions with DDL improves validation loss and perplexity, as well as downstream evaluation accuracy on language modeling tasks, with larger gains in the expanded-state setting.",

      "abstract": "News summary generation is an important task in the field of intelligence analysis, which can provide accurate and comprehensive information to help people better understand and respond to complex real-world events. However, traditional news summary generation methods face some challenges, which are limited by the model itself and the amount of training data, as well as the influence of text noise, making it difficult to generate reliable information accurately. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for news summary generation using LLM with powerful natural language understanding and generative capabilities. We use LLM to extract multiple structured event patterns from the events contained in news paragraphs, evolve the event pattern population with genetic algorithm, and select the most adaptive event pattern to input into the LLM to generate news summaries. A News Summary Generator (NSG) is designed to select and evolve the event pattern populations and generate news summaries. The experimental results show that the news summary generator is able to generate accurate and reliable news summaries with some generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "AI assistance produces significant productivity gains across professional domains, particularly for novice workers. Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.",

      "abstract": "Modeling time-evolving preferences of users with their sequential item interactions, has attracted increasing attention in many online applications. Hence, sequential recommender systems have been developed to learn the dynamic user interests from the historical interactions for suggesting items. However, the interaction pattern encoding functions in most existing sequential recommender systems have focused on single type of user-item interactions. In many real-life online platforms, user-item interactive behaviors are often multi-typed (e.g., click, add-to-favorite, purchase) with complex cross-type behavior inter-dependencies. Learning from informative representations of users and items based on their multi-typed interaction data, is of great importance to accurately characterize the time-evolving user preference. In this work, we tackle the dynamic user-item relation learning with the awareness of multi-behavior interactive patterns. Towards this end, we propose a new Temporal Graph Transformer (TGT) recommendation framework to jointly capture dynamic short-term and long-range user-item interactive patterns, by exploring the evolving correlations across different types of behaviors. The new TGT method endows the sequential recommendation architecture to distill dedicated knowledge for type-specific behavior relational context and the implicit behavior dependencies. Experiments on the real-world datasets indicate that our method TGT consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

Generally, there is a sequential nature and heterogeneity to the behavior of a person interacting with a system, leading to the proposal of multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR). MBSR is a relatively new and worthy direction for in-depth research, which can achieve state-of-the-art recommendation through suitable modeling, and some related works have been proposed. This survey aims to shed light on the MBSR problem. Firstly, we introduce MBSR in detail, including its problem definition, application scenarios and challenges faced. Secondly, we detail the classification of MBSR, including neighborhood-based methods, matrix factorization-based methods and deep learning-based methods, where we further classify the deep learning-based methods into different learning architectures based on RNN, GNN, Transformer, and generic architectures as well as architectures that integrate hybrid techniques. In each method, we present related works based on the data perspective and the modeling perspective, as well as analyze the strengths, weaknesses and features of these works. Finally, we discuss some promising future research directions to address the challenges and improve the current status of MBSR.",

      "abstract": "Multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) aims to incorporate behavior types of interactions for better recommendations. Existing approaches focus on the next-item prediction objective, neglecting the value of integrating the target behavior type into the learning objective. In this paper, we propose MBGen, a novel Multi-Behavior sequential Generative recommendation framework. We formulate the MBSR task into a consecutive two-step process: (1) given item sequences, MBGen first predicts the next behavior type to frame the user intention, (2) given item sequences and a target behavior type, MBGen then predicts the next items. To model such a two-step process, we tokenize both behaviors and items into tokens and construct one single token sequence with both behaviors and items placed interleaved. Furthermore, MBGen learns to autoregressively generate the next behavior and item tokens in a unified generative recommendation paradigm, naturally enabling a multi-task capability. Additionally, we exploit the heterogeneous nature of token sequences in the generative recommendation and propose a position-routed sparse architecture to efficiently and effectively scale up models. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that MBGen significantly outperforms existing MBSR models across multiple tasks.",

      "abstract": "In most real-world recommender systems, users interact with items in a sequential and multi-behavioral manner. Exploring the fine-grained relationship of items behind the users' multi-behavior interactions is critical in improving the performance of recommender systems. Despite the great successes, existing methods seem to have limitations on modelling heterogeneous item-level multi-behavior dependencies, capturing diverse multi-behavior sequential dynamics, or alleviating data sparsity problems. In this paper, we show it is possible to derive a framework to address all the above three limitations. The proposed framework MB-STR, a Multi-Behavior Sequential Transformer Recommender, is equipped with the multi-behavior transformer layer (MB-Trans), the multi-behavior sequential pattern generator (MB-SPG) and the behavior-aware prediction module (BA-Pred). Compared with a typical transformer, we design MB-Trans to capture multi-behavior heterogeneous dependencies as well as behavior-specific semantics, propose MB-SPG to encode the diverse sequential patterns among multiple behaviors, and incorporate BA-Pred to better leverage multi-behavior supervision. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MB-STR by significantly boosting the recommendation performance compared with various competitive baselines. Further ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of different modules of MB-STR.",
